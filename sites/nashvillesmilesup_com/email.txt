SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Help Patients Get Answers Fast—Day or Night

Hi Dr. Dudley,

I love how Nashville Smiles Up makes dental care truly accessible any time—your focus on after-hours and emergency treatment really stands out. I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours answer patient questions right away with a simple, custom AI chat agent that lives on your website.

We put together a demo using your own site as an example: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nashvillesmilesup_com.  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom right, type in a question, and the agent instantly provides answers using your existing web content.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I do if I have a tooth knocked out at 2am?
- How do I pay the emergency deposit for after-hours care?
- What kinds of insurance do you accept?
- Are walk-ins welcome, and what are your regular hours?
- How can I access new patient paperwork?

If you’d like to see how this could help more visitors find the answers and relief they need fast, I’d be glad to chat—no rush or pressure.

Take care,  
Zac Slay
