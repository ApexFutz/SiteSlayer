![Smiling african guy in dentist chair looking with trust at his doctor, close up. Young African American Man Getting Teeth Treatment With Professional Stomatologist At Modern Clinic]()

## Your OralFitnessCheck® Explained

The OralFitnessCheck helps detect early signs of gum disease and other health risks by measuring an enzyme called aMMP-8. Elevated levels can signal bacterial buildup or inflammation, which may be linked to conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s.

How it works:

- Rinse for 30 seconds.
- Spit into a cup.
- See your results in minutes.

Your dental care provider will explain what the results mean for your overall health.

**Important:** For the most accurate results, avoid eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth for at least 30 minutes before your appointment.

![OralFitnessCheck]()

## Understand Scaling and Root Planing

During a regular cleaning, the focus is on removing plaque and tartar from the surfaces of your teeth and along the gumline. However, if you have signs of gum disease, a regular cleaning may not be sufficient to address the underlying problem.

That’s where scaling and root planing come in. These procedures involve carefully removing plaque, tartar, and bacteria from the surfaces of your teeth and below the gumline. This thorough cleaning helps to eliminate infection and inflammation, which allows your gums to heal and your oral health to improve.

Scaling and root planing may be recommended if you have mild to moderate gum disease or if you’re at risk of developing gum disease due to factors such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes or genetic predisposition.

## How PPO Dental Plans Work

A Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is the most common form of dental insurance, offering members a network of participating dentists to choose from. Dentists in this network agree to lower fee schedules, resulting in greater cost savings for patients. PPO plans cover a percentage of treatment costs, typically paying 50% for major treatments like crowns and bridges, 80% for basic care like fillings, and up to 100% for preventative care such as exams and cleanings. These plans often have annual maximums ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 and assist with insurance billing.

## Understanding your HMO

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), also known as capitated or prepaid insurance, is a type of dental insurance plan that requires patients to choose a primary care dentist from a network of providers. This primary care dentist coordinates all aspects of the patient’s dental care and referrals to specialists within the HMO network. HMO plans typically have lower premiums and fixed copayments for covered services, but patients have limited choices in selecting dentists outside the network. Additionally, HMO plans may require patients to obtain pre-authorization for certain treatments, and coverage for out-of-network care is usually not provided except in emergencies.

## Dental Insurance FAQs

Got questions? We have answers! Check out our FAQ section to learn everything you need to know about navigating dental insurance coverage.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is optional treatment?

Treatment that is either not listed on your fee schedule or more than the minimum to restore the tooth back to its original function.

### What's a covered benefit?

Treatment that is recommended by a dentist, is listed on the fee schedule, and accepted under the terms of your group's plan.

### What's the difference between indemnity, PPO, HMO, & discount insurance plans?

Indemnity or Traditional Insurance reimburses members or dentists at the dentist's UCR (Usual, Customary & Reasonable fee). This allows the subscriber to go to any dental office without being limited to a panel.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is the most common dental emergency?

The most common dental emergency is a toothache. A toothache can be caused by a variety of factors such as tooth decay, a cracked or broken tooth, infection, or gum disease. Other common dental emergencies include a lost filling or crown, a broken or chipped tooth, and a knocked-out tooth.

### What should I do if I have a dental emergency after business hours?

We offer same-day appointments and extended hours to ensure that you receive timely care. Call our office and our answering service will direct you to the appropriate care.

### How can I prevent dental emergencies?

Dental emergencies can be prevented by maintaining good oral hygiene, wearing a mouthguard during contact sports, and avoiding hard and sticky foods.

### What should I do if my tooth is knocked out?

If a permanent tooth is knocked out, rinse it with water and reposition the tooth in the socket immediately before seeing a dentist. If that’s not possible, keep the tooth moist at all times either in your mouth or put it in milk and bring it to our office immediately.

### Will my dental insurance cover emergency dentist services?

Generally, most dental insurance plans cover emergency dental services. Our team will work with you to ensure you receive the care you need with the proper coverage.

## Experience the Difference of Advanced, Proven Technology

**Online Patient Portal**

Empower your healthcare journey with Smile Generation MyChart. With the convenience of the online patient portal, you can schedule and manage appointments, access billing and payments, and communicate directly with your clinician – all at your fingertips. Experience the convenience of managing your healthcare seamlessly and efficiently.

[GET STARTED WITH MYCHART](/patient-portal/)

**Digital X-Rays**

Digital X-rays offer a clear advantage in early detection and preventive care. By utilizing advanced image analysis, your doctor can identify early signs of gum disease through subtle changes in bone levels. This proactive approach, combined with comparisons to past treatments, ensures precise and encouraging dental care tailored to your individual needs.

[LEARN MORE ABOUT X-RAYS](/dental-services/dental-x-rays-and-imaging/)

**Cone Beam Computed Tomography**

Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is an advanced, proven technology that provides more precise three-dimensional (3D) imaging for more accurate diagnosis and treatment of oral health conditions. 3D dental X-rays can uncover issues that may not be detectable with 2D X-rays. By making images easier to see, it’s helpful in gaining a better understanding of oral health conditions and suggested treatment.

[LEARN MORE ABOUT CBCT](/dental-services/dental-x-rays-and-imaging/cbct/)

**CEREC® CAD/CAM**

CEREC® CAD/CAM technology revolutionizes dentistry by allowing for the creation of crowns in just two hours. There’s no need for temporaries and a second visit. It’s a precise fit and the process is less invasive for a durable and natural-looking smile.

[DISCOVER CEREC® TECH](/dental-services/dental-crowns/cerec-cadcam/)

**Laser Bacterial Reduction**

Laser bacterial reduction is a specific technique that uses laser technology to target and reduce harmful bacteria in the mouth. By using concentrated light therapy, LBR effectively eliminates bacteria that can lead to gum disease and other oral infections. This allows the gums to reattach to the bone for a healthy, infection-free outcome.

[EXPLORE THE LASER DIFFERENCE](/dental-services/periodontitis/)

**IntraOral Camera**

An intraoral camera is an indispensable diagnostic and educational tool. The tiny video camera moves around inside of your mouth and generates a tooth-by-tooth video exam of your teeth. Using an intraoral camera allows patients to better understand their dental needs by seeing what the dentist sees and then having it explained.

# Notice of Privacy Practices

**SMILE GENERATION**

**JOINT NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES AND NOTICE OF ORGANIZED HEALTH CARE ARRANGEMENT**

**THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. IF YOU HAVE**

**ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS NOTICE PLEASE CONTACT OUR “PRIVACY OFFICER” AT 714-845- 8605.**

We are required by law to maintain the privacy of protected health information and to provide you with this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to protected health information. “Protected health information” is information about you, including demographic information, that may identify you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition and related health care services or payment of health care services.

This Notice was published and became effective on April 1, 2020. We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice currently in effect. We may change the terms of this Notice at any time. The new Notice will be effective for all protected health information that we maintain at that time. You may obtain a copy of any revised Notice by accessing our website, calling our Privacy Contact and requesting that a revised copy be sent to you in the mail, or asking for one at the time of your next appointment.

**Organized Health Care Arrangement:** Pacific Dental Services, LLC (“PDS”) provides business support services to a number of entities engaged in the practice of dentistry (“Dental Entities”). All of the Dental Entities are included in the Smile Generation website maintained by PDS, and the dental office locations operated by the Dental Entities are listed at the following URL: http://www.smilegeneration.com/SiteMap.aspx, as updated from time to time. PDS, its subsidiaries and the Dental Entities are participants in an Organized Health Care Arrangement for purposes of federal privacy requirements and, accordingly, they may share information about you with each other for treatment, payment and operations purposes as described in this Notice. As used in this Notice, the words “we,” “our” and “us” collectively refer to PDS, its subsidiaries and the Dental Entities. This Notice applies to all Dental Entities that provide health care to you.

**USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION WITHOUT YOUR AUTHORIZATION**

**To Contact You:**We may use your protected health information to contact you to remind you about appointments, inform you about treatment options, or advise you about other health-related benefits and services.

**Treatment:**We may use and disclose your protected health information to provide, coordinate or manage your health care and any related services. This includes coordinating your health care with a third party, consulting with another health care provider, or referring you to another health care provider. For example, your dentist may need to know if you have other health problems that might complicate your treatment and therefore may request your medical record from another health care provider that has provided treatment to you. We may also share your health information with other providers outside of the Organized Health Care Arrangement described herein. The disclosure of your health information to others outside of the Organized Health Care Arrangement may be done electronically through a health information exchange such as Care Everywhere, that allows providers involved in your care to access some of your health information to coordinate services and treatment for you.

**Payment:**We may use and disclose your protected health information to obtain or provide payment for your dental services. This may include sharing information with the person or entity responsible for paying, such as your health insurer. Your insurance company or health plan may need your information for activities such as determining eligibility or coverage for insurance benefits and reviewing services provided to you. For example, we may give your insurance company information about your dental surgery so your insurance will pay for the care.

**Operations:** We may use or disclose your protected health information for our health care operations, such as to support our business activities and to ensure that quality dental care is provided. Some of these activities involve quality assessments, peer or employee review, training health care professionals, licensing and accreditation activities, data aggregation, compliance- or audit-related activities, and business planning and development. For example, we may use your information to evaluate the performance of our dentists and staff in providing care to you. We may also disclose your protected health information to another provider, health plan, or health care clearinghouse that has or has had a relationship with you for certain of its health care operations.

**Business Associates:** We may disclose your protected health information to third parties that perform services, such as billing or legal services. We have written contracts with third parties requiring them to protect the privacy of your protected health information.

**Treatment Alternatives and Health-Related Products and Services:** We may use or disclose your protected health information to provide you with information about certain products or services including to describe our participation in a dentist network or health plan network, products or services we provide or include in a plan of benefits, and alternative treatments, therapies, dentists or settings of care.

**Family and Friends:** We may disclose your protected health information to individuals, such as family and friends, who are involved in your care or who help pay for your care. We may do this if you tell us we can do so, or if you know we are sharing your information with these people and you do not object. If you are unavailable or unable to tell us your preference, we may also disclose your information if, based on our professional judgment, we believe that disclosing the information is in your best interest and you would not object. For example, we may assume you agree to disclosure of your information to your spouse if your spouse comes with you into the exam room or allow your spouse to pick up prescriptions, dental supplies and X-rays.

If you are a minor, you also may have the right to block parental access to your health information in certain circumstances, if permitted by state law. You can contact your dental provider or our Privacy Officer at the number at the top of this Notice.

**OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION**

**Health Oversight Activities:**We may disclose your protected health information to health oversight agencies, such as government agencies that oversee the health care system, government programs, or compliance with civil rights laws, for oversight activities such as audits, investigations, inspections and licensing.

**Lawsuits and Disputes:** We may use or disclose your protected health information in response to a court or administrative order in an administrative or judicial proceeding, or in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other legal process.

**Law Enforcement:** We may use or disclose your protected health information for law enforcement purposes, so as to respond to legal processes, identify or locate a suspect, provide information about crime victims, report crimes occurring on our premises, and report suspected crimes in a medical emergency.

**Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors:**We may disclose your protected health information to a coroner or medical examiner to identify a deceased person or determine the cause of death or for other lawful activities, or to a funeral director, as necessary to allow him/her to carry out his/her activities.

**Research:** We may use and disclose your protected health information in preparation for research or for research if and as approved by an institutional review board or privacy board.

**Serious Threat to Health or Safety; Disaster Relief:**We may disclose your protected health information to appropriate individuals or organization when and as necessary to prevent a serious threat to the health and safety of a person (including yourself) or of the public.

**USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION WITH YOUR AUTHORIZATION**

All uses and disclosures of your protected health information not covered by this Notice will be made only with your written authorization. For example, we will not sell your protected health information without your written authorization. Federal and state laws may provide additional protections or further limit how we may use or disclose your protected health information. We will comply with these laws and, when necessary, ask for your authorization to use or disclose your protected health information. Examples of protected health information that may be subject to special protections include psychotherapy notes, genetic information, mental health information, HIV/AIDS test results or information, reproductive health information, sexually transmitted or other communicable disease information, and alcohol or substance use disorder information.

You may revoke any authorization, at any time, by notifying, in writing, our Privacy Contact. If you revoke your authorization, we will no longer use or disclose your protected health information as allowed by the authorization, except to the extent we have already relied on the authorization.

**Right to Request Restrictions.**You may request that we not use or disclose any part of your protected health information for a particular treatment, payment or health care operations-related purpose. You may also request that any part of your protected health information not be disclosed to particular family members or friends who may be involved in your care.

We are not required to agree to a restriction that you may request, unless you request to restrict the disclosure of your protected health information to a health plan for payment or health care operations-related purposes and the protected health information relates only to a health care item or service for which you have paid in full and not through insurance. If we agree to the requested restriction, we may still use or disclose your protected health information as needed for emergency treatment.

**Right to Request Confidential Communications.**You may request that we communicate with you via alternative means or at an alternative location. For example, you may request that we contact you using your work phone number, rather than a home phone number. We will accommodate reasonable requests and will not require an explanation for the request, but we may require you to provide additional information to ensure we can contact you and arrange for billing and payment.

# California Consumer Privacy Policy

**PACIFIC DENTAL SERVICES® LLC**

**CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY POLICY**

**THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES TO OUR SITES, TRUSTED OFFICES, AND APPLICATIONS.**

**CCPA Privacy Policy for California Residents**Last Updated and Effective On: August 14, 2023

This CCPA Privacy Policy for California Residents (“CCPA Privacy Policy” or "Policy") supplements the information contained in Pacific Dental Services’ (“PDS,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) online [privacy notice](/privacy-policy/) and applies solely to consumers who are residents of the State of California (“consumers” or “you”).

We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). The CCPA imposes specific obligations on businesses processing personal information of California residents. Terms used in this CCPA Privacy Policy, such as personal information, consumers, third party(ies) and service providers, have the same meaning as they are defined in the CCPA. Pursuant to the CCPA, Pacific Dental Services is required to provide consumers a notice, used at or before the point of collection of personal information, that identifies the categories of personal information that may be collected, indicates the purpose of such collection, and provides the consumers rights related to such information.

**Notice at Collection**

At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notices of our practices, including the categories of personal and sensitive personal information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is sold or shared and how long such information is retained. You can find those details below.

**What Is Personal Information?**

The CCPA provides personal information rights to California residents. The CCPA defines personal information as information that “identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular” California consumer or household. Personal information does not include publicly available information or consumer information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.

**Categories of Personal Information We Collect About You**

- When you interact with the sites or our advertisements, we collect digital information using cookies, web beacons, page tags, pixels or similar tools that we and our service providers and other third parties have set.

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a list of dental offices for relevant referrals. Once you have selected a new dentist, we will share your information with your dentist.

For more information, see below for a list of the categories of personal information, along with some descriptions and examples that we may collect through each of the processes described above:
