SUBJECT: Quick way to help Big Thunder Events visitors get answers (see demo)

-----------------------------------------
Hi Tony & Kacey,

I love how Big Thunder Events is a true one-stop shop for everything from bounce houses to carnival rides—all with that friendly, local touch you bring to Murfreesboro and Nashville. Your site has tons of info and options, but with so many event planners and parents visiting, I imagine you get a LOT of the same questions.

I’d like to show you something simple that could help: at SlayDigital.ai, we build custom AI web chat agents that answer visitors’ questions using your own site content—no complicated setup needed.

Here’s a mock demo of your site with our chat agent added:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_bigthunderevents_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right, then type any question—your agent replies instantly using info from your pages.

You can try asking things like:
- What’s included in the bounce house rental price?
- How do I get a certificate of insurance for my event?
- Do you deliver and set up in Franklin or Brentwood?
- What power or space do I need for a mechanical ride?
- How do I check available dates or book online?

Our approach is all about clarity—making it easy for planners and parents to get exactly what they need, so you cut down on repetitive calls and bookings run even smoother.

Curious to see how this could fit for Big Thunder? Happy to chat or set up a quick call if you’re interested.

Best,  
Zac
