Hi Dr. Murfree,

I’m really impressed by how Murfree Dental combines advanced technology with a warm, welcoming atmosphere for your patients. Your “patient-first” approach and transparent info on services, financial options, and new patient support stand out.

I wanted to share something practical we do at SlayDigital.ai: we build simple web chat agents that help visitors get answers straight from your current site content—no AI buzzwords, just instant clarity. To show you how this could work on your site, we’ve set up a quick demo at: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_murfreedental_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right, type a question, and the agent will answer using details directly from your real website.

You can try asking things like:
- What are the options if I don’t have dental insurance?
- How do I schedule an appointment as a new patient?
- What types of sedation dentistry do you offer?
- Do you provide laser dentistry or dental implants?
- Where can I find your patient forms or hours?

This kind of agent can help reduce repetitive calls, make info easy to find, and get patients started faster—without adding extra work for your team.

Would you be interested in a quick chat to see if this could save your staff time (and make your patients’ lives easier)?

Best regards,
