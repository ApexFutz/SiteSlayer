# Dental Cleanings

### Dental Cleanings

Routine dental cleanings are essential for maintaining optimal oral health. Even with careful brushing and flossing, mineralized plaque can build up over time, particularly in areas that are hard to reach. Professional cleanings by a trained hygienist help ensure that your teeth and gums stay healthy, with recommendations to schedule a cleaning every six months.

#### What to Expect During Your Cleaning

Your dental cleaning will typically last between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your needs. A skilled hygienist will perform the cleaning, and at the end of the appointment, your dentist will usually conduct a brief exam to ensure everything looks great.

Most patients find dental cleanings to be completely painless and free of discomfort. It’s a simple and effective way to keep your smile shining!

#### The Two Key Steps in a Dental Cleaning

1. **Scaling**  
   The first step involves removing plaque and tartar buildup from the surface of your teeth. This is done with either manual tools or electric scalers, depending on your hygienist’s preference. The hygienist will also clean around the gum line to remove any plaque that may have accumulated in the pockets of your gums.
2. **Polishing**

The second step is polishing your teeth to remove any remaining plaque and give your smile a smooth, fresh finish. Special polishing tools are used to reach difficult spots and buff your teeth to a bright, shiny glow.

Regular cleanings are a vital part of your overall dental health. Not only do they help prevent cavities and gum disease, but they also leave you with a brighter smile and fresher breath. Schedule your next cleaning today!

BIO coming soon

![P38594_sp5903ps_t](/Account_Data/Account_1377/assets/P38594_SP5903PS_T.png)

Sarah, Expanded Duties Dental Assistant

I was born and raised in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, where I developed a strong appreciation for community and family. In 2017, I began my dental career as a registered dental assistant, driven by a desire to help people feel better about themselves, particularly through their smiles. As I grew in the field, I became an expanded function dental assistant in 2020, expanding my skills to offer more comprehensive care.
What I love most about dentistry is building meaningful connections with my patients, especially through my work with composite veneers. Helping people feel more confident in their smiles has become a passion, and there's nothing more rewarding than knowing I’ve made a positive impact on their lives.
When I’m not at the office, I live in Lebanon with my husband and two sons. We enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it's hunting, fishing, or simply enjoying our property. I’m grateful for the life I’ve built, the relationships I’ve formed, and the opportunity to continue making a difference in the lives of my patients.

![P38594_sp5620ps_t](/Account_Data/Account_1377/assets/P38594_SP5620PS_T.png)

Taylor, Expanded Duties Dental Assistant

I’ve been part of the Generations Dental Arts team since April 2020 and have truly enjoyed growing in my dental career. My journey began in 2017 in Hendersonville, near my hometown, where I started my dental career. It was there that I met my husband, David, a Lebanon native.
Since joining the Generations team, I've been passionate about providing excellent care and making dental visits a positive experience for all our patients—many of whom are understandably nervous about going to the dentist. In November 2022, I furthered my education by becoming an expanded duties assistant, specializing in restorative functions such as placing fillings, assisting with crowns, and working with implant planning and treatment. This specialized expertise allows me to offer advanced care options and ensure the best possible outcomes for patients seeking dental implants.
In 2024, I became a mother, which has been an incredibly rewarding new chapter in my life. Outside of dentistry, my husband and I enjoy spending time with our three dogs, staying active with workouts, traveling, and being involved in our church. We are avid lake enthusiasts, and most summer weekends you can find us enjoying the water. We also love spending time with family and watching sports of all kinds.
I look forward to meeting new patients and continuing to care for our long-term ones!

- Crystal D., 5 Star Google Review

  There are so many things about being a special needs family that are hard. Finding a dentist shouldn't be one of those things. With Dr. Mike and his staff, we not only found dental care, we found a family. Dr. Mike treats my children like his own. Not just dental care, but compassionate dental care. And, I love the convenience of special needs dentistry and dentistry for the rest of my family all under one roof!
- Judy M., 5 Star Google Review

  Wow, these folks are great. I had tooth work done for a crown today and felt no pain. Everyone here was caring and kind. I have been searching for a great dentist since I moved here a year ago. Thanks to a root canal (yuck!) I was referred here for the crown. Everything has a silver lining right? Even a root canal. :) A big THUMBS UP to Dr Mike and Brenda for their care today.
- Mike H., 5 Star Google Review

  My entire family is patients at Old Hickory Family Dentistry. Dr. Glasmeier is extremely knowledgeable in modern dentistry techniques and his staff provides that special personal touch that you desire. If you are looking for an ongoing dental relationship or have a unique dental situation, I highly recommend Dr. Glasmeier.

## Say Goodbye to Temporary Crowns: Discover the Convenience of Same-Day Crowns

In today’s fast-paced world, waiting days—or even weeks—for a dental crown is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Thanks to advancements in dental technology, **same-day crowns** are changing the game. If you’ve ever had to deal with multiple dental visits, temporary crowns that fall off, or just the inconvenience of waiting, this innovation is for you.

### What Are Same-Day Crowns?

Same-day crowns, also known as **3D printed crowns** are custom-made dental crowns that are designed, created, and placed in just one visit. Using CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) technology, your dentist can craft a permanent crown right in the office, often within a couple of hours.

### How Do They Work?

1. **Digital Impressions** – Say goodbye to messy molds. Your dentist uses a digital scanner to capture a precise 3D image of your tooth.
2. **Crown Design** – The dentist designs your crown digitally, ensuring a perfect fit and natural look.
3. **3d Printing**– The crown is pressed from a special machine that makes various products out of a very strong resin/ceramic material.
4. **Placement** – The crown is polished, checked for fit and bite, and then bonded into place—all in the same appointment.

### Benefits of Same-Day Crowns

- **Time-Saving**: No need for multiple visits or waiting weeks for a lab to deliver your crown.
- **No Temporary Crowns**: Temporary crowns can be uncomfortable and prone to falling off. Same-day crowns eliminate that hassle.
- **Comfort and Convenience**: Digital impressions are faster and more comfortable than traditional molds.
- **Durability and Aesthetics**: These crowns are strong, natural-looking, and designed to last for years with proper care.

### Are Same-Day Crowns Right for You?

Most patients who need a crown are great candidates for same-day treatment. Whether it's due to decay, a cracked tooth, or after a root canal, same-day crowns are an excellent solution. However, in complex cases or for specific cosmetic concerns, a traditional crown might still be recommended.

### Final Thoughts

Dental care doesn’t have to be a drawn-out process anymore. With same-day crowns, you can walk in with a problem and walk out with a permanent, beautifully restored tooth—all in just one visit.

Ready to save time and skip the hassle? Ask your dentist if same-day crowns are available at your next visit—you might be surprised how simple and stress-free getting a crown can be.

# Why do I have to be monitored during Sedation Dentistry?

# 

Question: Why do I have to be monitored during sedation...my dentist used to give me Valium and never had to monitor before?

Answer: This is very common question especially since monitoring was not alway considered a standard until recently. Most patients that undergo sedation typically are administered multiple medications for not only preparation for the visit but during the visit. A common example is a patient who elects for oral sedation and is prescribed Valium the night before and Triazolam/Vistaril the day of the appointment. In this particular situation, the Valium is used to assist with sleep the night before since most patients have a great deal of anxiety leading up to the appointment. The valium, too, will stay in your body much longer than some of the other medications which can help prolong and strengthen the level of sedation when given with other medications.

The triazolam/hydroxyzine is typically given the day of the apppointment which increases the level of "anxiolysis" or sedaton effects for the patient. While the valium alone does not typically have much effect on the patient in re: vital signs and level of consciousness, additional meds such as triazolam can heighten the sedation to a point where we can see changes in a person's breathing or blood pressure. As the sedation becomes greater the more relaxed a patient can become but also the muscles in the airway and others used for breathing. This is the answer to the original question because sedation can affect the respiratory ability of a patient, it is absolutely imperative that patients are monitored to detect for even the smallest of changes.

By monitoring blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, respirations and sometimes heart rhythms, we can deliver safe levels of sedation to a patient without being as concerned about what may happen in response to the administration of multiple oral medications. Monitoring is an ABSOLUTE must!

Hope this helps!

# Botox/Dermal Fillers

In response to numerous requests from patients, Generations Dental Arts has added Botox treatments for both therapeutic and cosmetic purposes, along with dermal filler options for the reduction of wrinkles near the mouth, sides of nose, and chin. Learn more about this procedure below!   
  
For inquiries or to schedule an appointment, please contact our office today.  
  
**What Is BOTOX?**

Botox (formally called Botulinum Toxin) is an extremely popular method for obtaining a more youthful, rested appearance. Botox is an FDA-approved treatment which can cause facial expression lines or wrinkles to essentially disappear. Areas most frequently treated are the glabellar area of frown lines (located between the eyes), crow's feet (lateral areas of the eyes), and forehead wrinkles. Botox is diluted to a very controlled solution and, when injected into the muscles with a very thin needle, is almost painless. Botox injections produce a more youthful appearance by softening deep wrinkles.  
  
**What does** **treatment** **involve?**

Treatment involves injecting small amounts of Botox into the tiny muscles responsible for the movements that create the lines and wrinkles. This relaxes the muscle, reducing the lines and wrinkles and producing smoother skin in the treated areas.

The most common treatment areas include:

· Vertical lines between the eyes

· Forehead wrinkles

· Crow's feet  
  
**What Can I Expect During the Procedure?**  
Patients may feel a slight burning sensation while the solution is being injected. The procedure takes about 15-20 minutes and the results last 3-5 months. With repeated treatments, the results may last longer. It requires a short appointment and is appropriate for anyone (male and female) ages 18-65 meeting the clinical criteria for therapeutic or cosmetic use.

**How is Botox used in Dentistry?**  
Botox has important clinical uses as an adjunct in TMJ and bruxism cases, and for patients with chronic TMJ and facial pain. Botox is also used to complement esthetic dentistry cases, as a minimally invasive alternative to surgically treating high lip line cases, denture patients who have trouble adjusting to new dentures, lip augmentation, and has its uses in orthodontic cases where retraining of the facial muscles is necessary.  
  
**Can A Dentist Inject Botox?**

YES - most dentists already have experience administering anesthetic injections in the same areas where Botox and dermal fillers are injected for cosmetic results. The only difference is that you inject intraorally into these facial structures while Botox and dermal fillers injections are extraoral injections. Dentists inject anesthetic for a living and know how to make these injections comfortable, quick, and relatively painless for their patients.  
  
Dentists receive training in dental school on the facial anatomy, physiology, skeletal structures, the vascular and nervous system of the face, and overall facial esthetics involved with this type of procedure.  
  
Dentists are also keenly aware of the proper ratios of lips to teeth, the proper amount of teeth that should be visible in a full or partial smile, and how the teeth relate to the soft tissue surrounding the mouth.  
  
While both Botox and dermal fillers are exciting additions to our services for patients, they are serious procedures which involve some risk and not every patient is an appropriate candidate.

For inquiries or to schedule an appointment, please contact our office today.

During the initial consultation, you will discuss your smile makeover goals and work with one of our experienced dentists to design a treatment plan that can meet your unique needs.

We will first conduct a [routine dental exam](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/dental-exams-and-x-rays.html) to make sure that your teeth and gums are healthy before beginning any cosmetic procedures. Once your treatment plan has been created, you will then be able to see a “preview” of your new smile using our state-of-the-art computer imaging technology.

During this time, you will be able to choose the ideal shape and shade of your teeth while using visual references to help ensure that you and our dentist have the same expectations going into your smile makeover procedure.

A smile makeover can include cosmetic and restorative treatments such as [porcelain veneers](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/dental-veneers.html), [porcelain crowns](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/porcelain-crowns.html), dental bonding, [dental implants](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/dental-implants.html), and [teeth whitening](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/teeth-whitening.html). These methods are used together to transform your smile!

# Tooth Extractions

A dental extraction is the procedure to remove a tooth from your mouth. A dental extraction is most commonly required if one of your teeth is damaged beyond practical repair. The most common reasons for tooth extractions include:

- Severe tooth decay or infection may make it impossible or too costly to repair a tooth
- Advanced gum disease may required a tooth to be pulled so it doesn’t affect the supporting tissues and bone structures of your mouth
- A tooth may be extracted if it is blocking other teeth from coming in
- During orthodontic work, teeth may need to be extracted to create room for the teeth that are being moved into place
- Wisdom teeth are often extracted either before or after they come in

What to expect  
Your dentist will first administer anesthetic to numb the area and reduce discomfort. During the extraction, you will feel the pressure of the tooth being removed, but will not feel any pain. Typically, the dentist is able to remove your tooth within a matter of minutes.  
  
Immediately after the tooth extraction, a small amount of bleeding is normal and patch of gauze will be placed in the affected area. The area may bleed minimally for the next 24 hours or so and taper off after that. Follow your dentist's instructions on how often to change the gauze, and what other post-procedure steps to follow.

# Dental Veneers

Dental veneers are thin custom-made shells that cover the front surface of your tooth to improve their appearance. They are made of tooth-colored materials and can be used to improve the color of teeth that have been worn down or stained. Alternatively, they can be used to improve the shape or size of the tooth.  
  
Types of veneers  
There are two types of veneers that are commonly used. Porcelain veneers are more durable and resist stains better. The properties of the material also help to create a very natural tooth look. Unlike porcelain veneers, composite resin veneers are not made in a laboratory, but instead directly applied to the teeth. They typically have a shorter life span and are less expensive.  
  
When should you consider dental veneers?  
You talk to your dentist about dental veneers if:

- Your teeth are stained or discolored teeth
- Your teeth are crooked or misshaped teeth
- Your teeth have spaces between them
- Your teeth are broken or chipped

How it's done  
Two visits to your dentist are typically required for porcelain veneers. At the first visit, three important steps are completed. Firstly, your teeth are prepared to be fitted with a veneer, which will involve trimming a portion of the tooth so the veneer can be bonded on top. Secondly, an impression is taken of your tooth which will be sent to a laboratory to prepare the veneer. Finally, you may receive a temporary veneer depending on how much of your tooth structure was removed. This temporary veneer will protect your tooth while the permanent veneer is prepared at the laboratory.  
  
At the second visit, the temporary veneer, if you received one, will be removed. Then, the new veneer received from the laboratory will be checked to see if it fits well. It's best not to adjust porcelain veneers after they are bonded to your teeth, so any adjustments will be made beforehand. Once you and the dentist are satisfied with the look and feel of the veneer, it will be bonded to your tooth.

# Porcelain Crowns

Compared to fillings which just cover a small portion of a tooth, a crown (or cap) encases the entire visible portion of a tooth. In effect, the crown acts as the tooth's new outer surface. A dental crown is used when a tooth is broken or decayed to such an extent that fillings aren't able to repair the problem.

The crown is able to provide a protective shell around the damaged or decayed tooth to strengthen it, as well as to improve the appearance of the tooth. They can also help restore a tooth to its original shape, are used commonly for teeth that have been broken. While crowns come in different materials, the most common crowns typically have some mixture of porcelain in them to give them a look and feel similar to a natural tooth.  
  
How it's done  
The first visit to your dentist involves reshaping the tooth and taking impressions to create the crown. Typically a portion of your tooth will have to be removed for the crown to fit properly. After the dentist reshapes your tooth, he will use a special material to create an impression of it. This impression will be sent to a dental laboratory to be made into a permanent crown. Before sending you home, the dentist will provide you with a temporary crown to cover your tooth in between visits.  
  
When you return to your dentist, he will have received the permanent crown from the laboratory. He will remove the temporary crown and fit the new permanent one. Before cementing the permanent crown in place, he will ensure that it fits comfortably and matches the color of your teeth.

# Sedation Dentistry for Children

**Nitrous Oxide**

Nitrous oxide, also know as laughing gas, helps patients relax during their dental visits. It is given through a small breathing mask which is placed over the child's nose. The gas has a sweet scent and it is quickly eliminated from the body at the completion of the treatment. While inhaling nitrous oxide, the patient remains fully conscious and keeps all natural reflexes. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recognizes this technique as a safe, effective technique to use for treating children's dental needs.

**General Anesthesia**  
We also offer anesthesia administered by a dental anesthesiologist in our practice. Intravenous sedation is a good option for younger or anxious patients with extensive dental treatment. While the dentist focuses on the treatment the anesthesiologist monitors the anesthetic prior to, during and after the procedure.

Side effects can vary but nausea and rarely a sore throat can occur. In the unlikely event that there is nausea afterward, there are excellent medications to deal with this side effect.   
  
There are however some patients who are not candidates for in-office anesthesia due to medical conditions. These patients will need to be treated in a Hospital setting. Please call our office to find out if your child is a candidate.

# Dental Bridges

A dental bridge is a false tooth that is used to fill the gap created by missing tooth or teeth. A gap between your teeth can be potentially dangerous to your dental health, as it can cause your teeth to shift resulting in a change in your bite that could be painful. Dental bridges help alleviate this problem by using the two surrounding teeth as anchors to hold a false tooth in the place where the gap is. Typically, porcelain crowns are placed over the surrounding teeth, and the false tooth, known as a pontic, is fused between them.  
  
Types of dental bridges   
There are three types of dental bridges that are commonly used today:  
  
1. Traditional fixed bridge – This is the most common type of dental bridge, in which porcelain crowns are placed over the two surrounding teeth and used as anchors to hold the false tooth in place. The false tooth is usually made of either porcelain fused to metal or ceramics.  
  
2. Cantilever bridge – A cantilever bridge is used when teeth are present on only one side of the gap. These are used typically in areas of your mouth that doesn’t experience an intense chewing load, such as your front teeth.  
  
3. Resin-bonded bridge – In a resin-bonded bridge, metal bands are bonded to the surrounding teeth with resin and used to hold a plastic false tooth in place. This type of bridge is typically used in areas of the mouth that undergo less stress, such as the front teeth.  
  
How it's done  
A minimum of two visits is required for placing a dental bridge. At the first visit, three important steps are completed. Firstly, the surrounding teeth are prepared to be fitted with a crown. This may including filing down the tooth so that the crown can fit over it. Secondly, an impression is taken of your teeth which will be sent to a laboratory to prepare the bridge and crown. Finally, the dentist fits your teeth with a temporary bridge to protect them while the bridge is prepared at the laboratory.  
  
At the second visit, the temporary bridge is removed and the new bridge received from the laboratory is fitted and adjusted. Multiple visits may be necessary to check and adjust the fit.

# Second Opinions

***Need A Second Opinion?***

Have you been told you need a great deal of dental work and not sure if it's accurate? Are you unsure of what has been presented or concerned if the cost of treatment is reasonable. Have you been to a corporate dental office that tells you have 8 cavities when you previously had none and they are ready to do work on the spot as well as able to finance your treatment before you have had time to process their recommendations?

Look no further and consult with Dr.Glasmeier about your dental needs as well as your concerns. Dr.Glasmeier has a great deal of expertise and will be able to decipher your treatment in a conservative manner so you understand the difference between the dental treatment that is "needed" and "wanted."

If you have current X-rays (within the past 6 months) as well as a treatment plan, Dr.Glasmeier will offer you a complimentary exam and treatment plan. If you have no previous treatment plan/X-rays, we will provide all the X-rays you need along with a comprehensive exam for $49.

For additional details, please call our office and we will be more than happy to help any way we can. We guarantee you will appreciate his conservative approach and willingness to explain things in a manner that you can understand and be confident in your decisions!

There are so many things about being a special needs family that are hard. Finding a dentist shouldn't be one of those things. With Dr. Mike and his staff, we not only found dental care, we found a family. Dr. Mike treats my children like his own. Not just dental care, but compassionate dental care. And, I love the convenience of special needs dentistry and dentistry for the rest of my family all under one roof!

- Crystal D., 5 Star Google Review

Wow, these folks are great. I had tooth work done for a crown today and felt no pain. Everyone here was caring and kind. I have been searching for a great dentist since I moved here a year ago. Thanks to a root canal (yuck!) I was referred here for the crown. Everything has a silver lining right? Even a root canal. :) A big THUMBS UP to Dr Mike and Brenda for their care today.

- Judy M., 5 Star Google Review

My entire family is patients at Old Hickory Family Dentistry. Dr. Glasmeier is extremely knowledgeable in modern dentistry techniques and his staff provides that special personal touch that you desire. If you are looking for an ongoing dental relationship or have a unique dental situation, I highly recommend Dr. Glasmeier.

- Mike H., 5 Star Google Review

I've been a patient of Dr. Helms for more than 20 years. I never thought I'd find another dentist who could meet his high standards and phenomenal service but I was wrong. Dr. Glasmeier is the perfect addition to this dental office!

The professionalism and care from the ENTIRE team is unlike anywhere else. And you know what ELSE you won't find anywhere else? Zero wait times. Nobody in this practice has ever kept me waiting. My appointment time is just that. Mine. I don't have to wait because of over-bookings, as is typical in so many other practices. They respect my time and that's a rare thing.

Thanks, Dr. Glasmeier!

# Special Needs Dentistry Antioch, Special Needs Dentistry Nashville

Patients with special needs are patients that require special conditions/considerations when receiving dental treatment. Whether the impairment is medical, physical, emotional, developmental, special attention must be given to the patient and tailored to their specific disability and needs. This includes, but not limited to, Autism, Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, cerebral palsy and other spinal cord injuries.

![](/Account_Data/Account_1357/editor/original_original_tyandjake.jpg)

Over 20% of our population presents with some form of disability and these disabilities can affect everyday life. The smallest of actions, such as brushing your teeth can be problematic for patients. Limitations such as this can increase the possibility of tooth decay and gum disease. Patients that have some type of cognitive deficit or mental disability may not understand the importance of good oral health. In addition to this, the sights and sounds of dentistry can create anxiety and fear that cannot be overcome.  
  
Despite the impairment, finding a dental provider can be challenging and most patients require someone who:

1. Has previous experience with special needs patients

2. Be in constant communication with the patient’s parents, caretakers, physicians and/or therapists

3. Have access to surgical center facilities where treatment can be rendered safely and methodically.

4. Able to empathize with the struggles of taking care of a loved one with special needs.  
  
Treating a special need patient takes compassion and understanding and being able to focus on the needs and limitations to deliver the best possible outcome in a safe, conservative manner.  
  
Dr.Glasmeier is a dentist in Antioch and Old Hickory TN who provides dental care to special needs children and adults who are looking for someone comfortable with restoring optimal dental health. As a dedicated father of 2 Autistic children, Dr.Glasmeier understands the importance of being able to provide the treatment your loved one requires. Dr.Glasmeier has treated hundreds of special needs children in his facility as well as having privileges at a local surgical center that provides general anesthesia for your loved one's safety. Email or call us today to find out how we can help improve the oral health of your loved one!  
  
Please email us at [drmikeglasmeier@aol.com](mailto:drmikeglasmeier@aol.com) for additional information or contact our office at Generations Dental Arts at 615-758-9117 or our Antioch office at 615-731-8960.

# Why Our Mount Juliet TN Dentist Believes Summer Dental Visits are Essential for a Sunny Smile

Who is a candidate for IV Sedation dentistry?

A candidate for IV sedation in dentistry may include someone who:

Has dental anxiety or phobia

Has a strong gag reflex

Has difficulty staying still

Has a low pain tolerance

Needs extensive dental work

Has a history of traumatic dental experiences

Has special needs, such as physical, cognitive, or behavioral needs

Are You a Good Candidate for IV Sedation? - Dental Brothers

IV sedation can be used for patients of all ages, including children and seniors. It can help patients feel relaxed and comfortable during dental procedures, which can be especially beneficial for those who might otherwise avoid dental appointments.

However, IV sedation is not suitable for everyone. Some health conditions may prevent someone from being a candidate, including: Pregnancy, Allergies to sedatives, Glaucoma, Liver or heart problems, and Obesity.

A medical provider can offer guidance on what is best for your situation.

# Dental Exams and X-Rays

Routine dental exams are important to maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Additionally, they can help to avoid the financial costs associated with large treatment plans later on. The Academy of General Dentistry recommends twice yearly checkups for people of all ages. At this frequency, most problems can be caught while they remain in an early stage.

**How it's done**

The dentist first examines your mouth visually, using dental equipment such as mouth mirrors, dental picks, and high intensity lights. They will look for cracked and decayed teeth, as well as review other important items such as:

Medical history review: The dentist will assess how any new medical conditions or illnesses may affect your dental health.

Examination of tooth decay: Your mouth will be checked for cracked or decayed teeth.

Oral cancer screening: The face, neck, lips, tongue, throat, tissues, and gums will be checked for any signs of oral cancer.

Gum disease evaluation: Your gums and bone around the teeth will be checked for any evidence of periodontal disease.

Examination of existing restorations: Current fillings, crowns, and other restorations are made sure to be in good order.

Additionally, your dentist will take diagnostic x-rays to reveal any other hidden problems, especially in the areas below the gums. Bitewing x-rays are typically taken every 12 months and a panographic x-ray, which revolves around the head, is taken every 3-5 years.

# Sedation Dentistry

Many people are commonly fearful of going to the dentist even before they arrive at the office. Sedation dentistry may be recommended by your dentist to help reduce anxiety and allow for longer procedures to be completed in one visit.

Sedation dentistry allows you to stay awake, while deeply relaxed, during the procedure. This means, you will still be able to follow direction from the dentist, and it will put you at ease during the appointment. Due to the length of some procedures, we may suggest the use of sedatives even if the patient is not uneasy. The alternative, general anesthesia, puts patients to sleep during dental procedures.

The sedatives have some similarities to general anesthesia:

- longer procedures can be completed
- the patient has no memories of the procedure

Sedatives can be administered using a variety of methods:

- Nitrous oxide
- Oral medications
- Intravenous sedatives

Our two priorities during procedures that require sedation are your comfort and safety. Our team is fully trained and very experienced in monitoring patients and recognizing issues after administration of the medicine.

# Composite Fillings

When treating a cavity, the dentist will remove the decayed portion of your tooth and fill it with another substance. This procedure is called a filling. There are multiple options for the material to be used in the filling, the most common of which are composite fillings and amalgam fillings.  
  
A composite filling is also known as a tooth-colored filling since the material used in the filling can be closely matched to the color of your teeth. Composite fillings provide good durability for small to medium cavities, and the procedure typically involves removing less of a tooth than you would during an amalgam filling. They are also particularly well suited for treating front or highly visible teeth because of their natural look.  
  
**When can a composite filling be used for?**

- Decayed tooth (i.e. cavity)
- Chipped or broken teeth
- Decreasing the gap between teeth

**How it's done**  
After the dentist numbs the area where the filling is to be placed, he will remove any decayed portions. A substance is then applied to help open up the pores of your teeth for a stronger bond, and hardened and cured with a special light. Once this is complete, the filling is applied in thin layers to slowly form the complete filling. After the composite has hardened, the filling will be smoothened and polished to be comfortable and fit your bite.

# Dentures

Is your denture comfortable?

Does it stay in place when you talk, laugh, or chew food?

Does your denture interfere with your speech?

Do you have good lip support and adequate space for your tongue?

Does your denture look natural?

Your denture should be an extension of you--personalized in every way. We encourage you to share with us the problems you may be having with your current denture and the expectations you have for a new one. We have seen the confidence patients have when they have a comfortable, natural-looking denture. Let us provide you with the most thoughtful and meticulous approach to denture design.

# Teeth Whitening

Our teeth can discolor through the years as our enamel wears down. The wearing down of enamel allows dentin, a yellow color substance that makes the core of our teeth, to show through. This is what gives our teeth a yellowish tint. Teeth whitening helps restore teeth to a shiny white color through the use of bleach.  
  
Teeth whitening methods  
There are two popular teeth whitening options available through your dentist. The first, in-office teeth whitening, produces a significant color change in your teeth in a short amount of time, usually within an hour. The procedure is done at the dentist's office by applying a high-concentration peroxide gel on the teeth after they have been protected with a special shield.  
  
The second method involves the use of take-home whitening kits. These whitening kits are purchased from your doctor for use at home. The strength of the gel used in these kits is lower than that used for in-office bleaching, and thus the gel can be applied for longer periods of time. Usually, the trays are worn a couple hours a day or overnight for a few days or weeks depending on the product.  
  
It's best to consult your dentist to understand which whitening option is best for you.

# Pediatric Dentistry

# Dental Cleanings & X-Rays

Professional cleanings (dental prophylaxis) form the foundation for preventing gum disease and tooth decay. The patient will have 2 things done during the cleaning:

- The removal plaque and tartar from the teeth with a hand held scaler or electroninc scaler. The scaler is usually not used under the age of 6.
- Polish and remove stains from teeth

# X-Rays

Radiographs (X-Rays) are a vital and necessary part of your child’s dental diagnostic process. Without them, certain dental conditions can and will be missed. Radiographs allow dentists to diagnose and treat health conditions that cannot be detected during a clinical examination. If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable for your child and more affordable for you.

The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends radiographs and examinations every six months for children with a high risk of tooth decay.  Approximately every 3 years, it is a good idea to obtain a complete set of radiographs, either a panoramic and bitewings or periapicals and bitewings.

With contemporary safeguards, the amount of radiation received in a dental X-ray examination is extremely small. The risk is negligible. In fact, the dental radiographs represent a far smaller risk than an undetected and untreated dental problem. Lead body aprons and shields will protect your child. Today’s equipment filters out unnecessary x-rays and restricts the x-ray beam to the area of interest. High-speed film and proper shielding assure that your child receives a minimal amount of radiation exposure.

# Dental Sealants

Dental sealants are ideal for application to children's teeth, particularly molars, soon after they have erupted and before they have a chance to decay. A child's first set of molars come in when he or she is around 6 years old and the second set appear around 12 years old.

The process is quick and easy and will be done right after a cleaning is completed. A special gel is placed on the chewing surface for a few seconds followed by the sealant itself. While talking your child, you won't be able to see the sealant.

While sealants can last as long as 5 to 10 years, they should be checked during regular dental appointments and can be reapplied if necessary.

# Composite Restoration

Composite resin is a filling material designed for aesthetic dental restorations. Formulated to resemble the color of your natural tooth, composite resin is often used for filling dental cavities or for dental bonding front teeth.

Composite resin consists of glass or quartz filler added to a resin medium, which produces a tooth-colored filling. The invention of composite resin offers a substitute to the amalgam dental fillings we've grown so accustomed to. This plastic and glass mixture contains no metal and can be shaped to resemble a real tooth.

# 

# Stainless Steel Crowns

Severe cavities or exceptionally large cavities destroy so much of the natural tooth surface that the only way to save the tooth and preserves its normal function is to cap it with a stainless steel crown.  This will cover the tooth and prevent further tooth decay. Stainless steel crowns are a lot easier to fit to primary teeth than are porcelain crowns to adult teeth. Stainless steel crowns are pre-manufactured so only one appointment is needed. Meaning kids do not have to miss more than half a day of school to have their teeth fitted.

 

Stainless steel crowns are amazingly resilient and easy for children to take care of, and they are far less expensive than adult crowns. There is great benefit to saving a primary tooth so it can live out its natural lifespan.  Not only does it prevent tooth decay from spreading down to the gums and to other teeth, but it also prevents premature primary tooth loss which invariably result in spacing and alignment problems when gaps form in a childs smile.

# Dental Implants

Dental implants are becoming an increasingly popular method for replacing missing teeth. In this procedure, titanium supports are surgically fused with your jawbone, and act as an anchor for naturally looking false teeth. Dental implants are not only used for individual tooth replacement, but can also be used when replacing multiple teeth as an alternative to dentures.   
  
Advantages of dental implants  

- Implants are extremely natural looking
- Fusion of the implants into your jaw make them very stable and comfortable compared to traditional dentures
- They last a lifetime

  
Disadvantages of dental implants  

- Implants are expensive and a major financial investment
- The process of getting implants can be time consuming and requires multiple visits to the dentist
- There is a chance the surgery fails (roughly 5% of the time)

  
Types of implants  
Your dentist will be able to tell you which of the three types of implants is right for you:   

- Root form implant: This is the most common type of implant where the screw is shaped like the root of a tooth.
- Plate Form Implant:A plate form implant has a flat and long shape and is better suited for a narrow jawbone.
- Subperiosteal Implants: In some cases where there is not enough bone width or height for the root form or plate form implant, a subperiosteal implant may be prescribed. This type of implant is designed to sit on top of the bone, but under the gums.

**Mini Implants for Dentures: A Small Solution for a Big Smile**

For many people struggling with loose or ill-fitting dentures, mini dental implants have become a game-changing solution. These tiny yet powerful implants offer a minimally invasive way to stabilize dentures, restore chewing function, and boost confidence—all without the lengthy recovery time of traditional implants. In this blog, we’ll explore what mini implants are, how they work with dentures, and whether they might be the right fit for you.

---

### What Are Mini Dental Implants?

Mini dental implants (MDIs) are narrower than traditional implants—typically less than 3mm in diameter. Made from titanium, they are designed to act like artificial tooth roots, anchoring dentures securely in place. Unlike full-sized implants, mini implants require less bone structure, making them a great option for patients who have experienced bone loss.

---

### How Mini Implants Work with Dentures

Mini implants are placed directly into the jawbone through a minimally invasive procedure, often completed in a single visit. The denture is then fitted with special attachments that snap onto the implants, providing a stable and secure fit.

**Benefits include:**

- **No more slipping or clicking** – enjoy meals and conversations without worry.
- **Improved comfort** – less irritation to the gums.
- **Easier maintenance** – dentures can still be removed for cleaning.
- **Faster healing** – most patients resume normal activities within 24–48 hours.

---

### Who Is a Candidate for Mini Implants?

Mini implants are ideal for:

- Patients with loose or unstable lower dentures.
- Those with insufficient bone for traditional implants.
- Seniors looking for a less invasive alternative to full implant surgery.
- Patients seeking a more affordable implant option.

A thorough dental exam and imaging will help determine if mini implants are the right choice for you.

---

### The Procedure: What to Expect

1. **Consultation & Planning**: Your dentist will evaluate your oral health and take X-rays or a CT scan.
2. **Placement**: Using local anesthesia, the implants are placed into the jawbone. No cutting or stitches are typically required.
3. **Attachment**: Dentures are modified or fabricated to connect securely to the implants.
4. **Follow-Up**: Regular checkups ensure the implants are functioning properly.

---

### Advantages Over Traditional Implants

While traditional implants are highly effective, mini implants have distinct advantages:

- **Less invasive surgery**
- **Lower cost**
- **Quicker recovery**
- **Can be used when bone density is low**

However, they may not be ideal for replacing individual teeth or supporting full arch restorations in all cases.

---

### Cost and Longevity

Mini implants are generally more affordable than traditional implants, but pricing can vary depending on how many implants are needed and the type of denture used. With proper care, mini implants can last many years, though they may have a slightly shorter lifespan than standard implants.

---

### Final Thoughts

Mini dental implants offer a smart, effective, and budget-friendly way to stabilize dentures and reclaim a better quality of life. If you're tired of denture adhesives or the embarrassment of slipping dentures, talk to your dentist about whether mini implants are right for you.

**Your smile deserves to be strong, stable, and confident—no matter your age. Give us a call so we can book a consultation for you!**

# Our Dentist in Mount Juliet Discusses How to Recognize if You Need a Root Canal

When it comes to dental health, few words stir as much concern as "root canal." Yet, this common procedure is a crucial tool in a dentist's arsenal for preserving natural teeth and alleviating pain. Understanding the signs that you might need a root canal, as well as the procedure's safety, can help ease your worries. Learn more below with the help of our dentist in Mount Juliet.

**When to Consider a Root Canal**

The first sign that you might need a root canal is persistent pain. This discomfort can vary from a dull ache to sharp pain and often worsens when you bite down. Sensitivity to hot or cold that lingers long after the temperature has changed is another red flag.

Additionally, if you notice swollen gums, darkening of the tooth, or a small, pimple-like bump on your gums, it's time to consult our dentist in Mount Juliet. These symptoms suggest that the nerve of your tooth might be infected or damaged.

**The Safety of Root Canals**

Many people worry about the safety of root canals due to myths and misinformation. However, root canals are not only safe but also a pain-free way to save your natural tooth. Our Mount Juliet TN dentist can perform root canal treatments with modern techniques and anesthesia with minimal discomfort.

The procedure involves removing the infected or damaged nerve tissue, cleaning the inside of the tooth, and sealing it to prevent further infection. This process eliminates the infection, preserves the tooth, and restores your oral health.

**A Dentist's Commitment to Your Teeth**

Dentists prioritize saving your natural tooth whenever possible. A root canal is often the best way to achieve this. Saving your natural tooth can prevent other teeth from drifting out of line and causing jaw problems. It also helps maintain your natural smile and continues the function of chewing food effectively.

**Trust in Root Canal Therapy**

Root canal therapy stands as a testament to modern dentistry's ability to preserve natural teeth and enhance oral health. Recognizing the signs that you might need a root canal and understanding the safety and benefits of the procedure can help alleviate any concerns.

As your trusted dentist in Mount Juliet, we’re committed to saving your natural tooth and ensuring your comfort throughout the process. Embrace root canal therapy as a positive step towards maintaining your dental health and well-being!
