## What Is a Smile Makeover?

[Cosmetic dentistry in Nashville, TN](/services/cosmetic-dentistry/), aims to improve the aesthetics of your gums and teeth by combining various dental procedures.

## Payment Options


![Crooked teeth]()

### Crooked Teeth

Minor misalignment can be effectively concealed with veneers, or we can move the teeth into alignment with [Invisalign in Nashville, TN](/services/invisalign/).

![Gapped teeth]()

### Gapped Teeth


The cosmetic dentists at our Nashville practice offer a comprehensive scope of treatments:


### [Invisalign](/services/invisalign/)

InvisalignÂ® straightens teeth using smooth, comfortable plastic aligners. By switching to a new set of customized trays every two weeks, you can discreetly and gently realign crooked teeth and a misaligned bite. We work closely with an orthodontist who visits our office for the best treatment results. It's important to keep in mind that Invisalign only treats mild-to-moderate misalignment. If you have a more complex case, our visiting orthodontist can recommend an alternative treatment.

[![Man smiling with a professional whitening device in bottom corner]()](/services/teeth-whitening)

### [Teeth Whitening](/services/teeth-whitening/)

Our doctors offer multiple options to help patients achieve a brighter smile, including in-office laser whitening, which can noticeably whiten your teeth in just one appointment. We also provide Opalescence Goâ¢ and customized take-home trays, which can achieve comparable results to in-office whitening in just a few weeks. Take-home kits allow you to apply bleaching gel to custom trays at home to gradually illuminate your teeth for a healthier, more attractive appearance.

[![Mature woman with smooth skin and a bottle of BOTOX Cosmetic in the bottom corner]()](/services/botox)

### [BOTOX Cosmetic](/services/botox/)

BOTOXÂ® Cosmetic is an injectable treatment that blocks facial muscle contractions. You do not lose any sensation in your face or skin, and you can enjoy a smoother, more youthful-looking appearance. Each BOTOX treatment generally lasts from three to four months, depending on personal factors, and you'll be able to resume your regular daily activities immediately after your appointment. BOTOX is a proven, safe method for aesthetic enhancements.

[![man smiling with a dental shade matcher in the bottom corner]()](/services/smile-makeover)

### [Smile Makeovers](/services/smile-makeover/)


![Gulch Dental Studio patient before and after cosmetic dentistry]()

Veneers gave this patient brighter teeth while improving the shape of her whole smile.

In both cases, we achieved dramatic results that brought out the best qualities in their smiles for an outcome that looks entirely natural. If you're ready to elevate your smile, don't settle for anything less than customized dental care solutions by a dentist using the best materials and techniques.

## Are You a Candidate?

We want to make sure your smile is ready for long-lasting cosmetic results. During your consultation, we will consider:

### Your Oral Health

Prior to recommending cosmetic dentistry, your dentist will ensure your oral health is optimal and address and treat any underlying issues like [gum disease](/services/periodontics) or tooth decay. Cosmetic treatments are not advised for individuals with active dental problems.

### Your Goals

Cosmetic dentistry patients should set realistic expectations about their goals for treatment. Our dentists can offer personalized advice on achievable outcomes and suitable procedures to meet your dentistry goals.


![Woman smiling while flossing her teeth]()

> Whenever it's time for some touch-up work, our cosmetic dentists can discuss what procedures will be needed and how much it will cost. Like your initial treatment, we'll be sure to provide answers to any questions you may have.

## What About Missing or Damaged Teeth? Our Restorative Treatments Can Repair Your Smile

Our skilled dentists do more than just cosmetic dentistry. At our dental studio in Nashville, you can receive a range of restorative dentistry services that restore the health, form, and function of your smile. Each of these procedures is performed with the same artistry and customization we dedicate to aesthetic procedures. Some of our most popular restorative treatments include:

![Woman relaxing in dental chair]()

- ### [Dental Implants](/services/dental-implants/)

  Dental implants are the best solution for missing teeth. They provide unparalleled stability for prosthetic teeth and critical support to your jawbone, helping to preserve your oral health and natural facial structure. Whether you need to replace a single tooth with an implant-supported dental crown or a full arch of teeth with an implant-supported denture, your results will look indistinguishable from the real thing and offer you the same ease when eating, speaking, and smiling.
- ### [Tooth-Colored Fillings](/services/fillings/)

  We use a lifelike composite resin blend to create our dental fillings. This material can be color-matched to the precise shade of the enamel on the treated tooth. It is also resistant to especially hot and cold temperatures, which means it stays flush with your tooth and doesn't expand or contract as metal fillings can. If you have older metal fillings and you're ready for an upgrade, we can easily replace them with composite fillings to give your smile a more seamless look.
- ### [Full Mouth Reconstruction](/services/full-mouth-reconstruction/)

  Considered the restorative counterpart to the smile makeover, a full mouth reconstruction gives you a way to address multiple issues that compromise the health and function of your smile at once. Your dentist will examine your teeth and speak with you about your treatment goals. The two of you will work together to choose a combination of restorative procedures that can completely transform your dental health, bite, and self-confidence by the end of your treatment.

[Explore Restorative Dentistry at Gulch Dental Studio](/services/restorative-dentistry/)

## Are You Ready for a Brand New Smile? Request a Consultation for Cosmetic Dentistry Treatment

With the advancements in dentistry available today, there's no reason to go through life with a smile that you are not happy to share.


Neither of our full-time dentists are orthodontists. However, we have an orthodontic specialist come into our Nashville office every other Friday to help with more complex cases that we cannot handle without their cooperation. If your alignment needs are generally straightforward, our experienced dentists can address your concerns themselves.

### What cosmetic dentistry qualifications do your dentists have?

Besides the experience gained by improving the look of countless patients' smiles, our dentists are also affiliated with the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD) to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.
![Dental x-ray showing severely damaged teeth]()

Damaged or missing teeth can cause a cascade of related issues. Prompt treatment is necessary to protect your dental function and appearance.

## Commonly Performed Procedures

Restorative dentistry is a branch of dental care that focuses on replacing or strengthening damaged teeth while helping patients recover their ability to eat, smile, and speak comfortably. Rather than emphasizing the cosmetic appeal of your smile, restorative treatment aims to improve patients' oral health.

> Your dentist will always take the time to listen to your goals and concerns, answering all your questions and determining which treatment plan is best for your unique needs.

Whether you need a [tooth extraction](/services/tooth-extraction), chipped tooth repair, cavity repair, or a [full mouth reconstruction](/services/full-mouth-reconstruction), these types of procedures can help you get back to your normal routine. Restorative dentistry offers several versatile treatment options and approaches including:

### Dental Implants

[Dental implants](/services/dental-implants) are surgically placed titanium posts inserted into your jaw bone. After several months, a process called osseointegration fuses the titanium with your jawbone, creating a stable and permanent foundation for restorations. By replacing missing dental roots, implants preserve a strong, healthy jaw. We can evaluate your candidacy, coordinate care, and refer you to a trusted doctor for the placement of implants, then provide beautiful-looking restorations.

### Dental Crowns and Bridges

Traditional [dental crowns](/services/dental-crowns) are designed to strengthen and protect weak, damaged teeth. An implant-supported crown can replace a single missing tooth. Our office also offers all-ceramic crowns and [IPS e.maxÂ®](/services/ips-emax-crowns) dental crowns. Whether traditional or implant-supported, [dental bridges](/services/dental-bridges) can replace one or more adjacent missing teeth and allow you to eat and chew comfortably again. This is also a good option for preserving the alignment of your remaining teeth and the youthful shape of your cheeks and face.

### Dentures

Implant-supported dentures are similar to implant-supported bridges in that the restorations are attached to permanent implants. This option is better for your jaw bone density and preservation in the long run, because simply wearing dentures on top of your gums allows the jawbone to atrophy underneath.

# Dental Bonding

Cosmetic imperfections such as chips, gaps, or stains can **diminish the beauty of your smile and impact your self-confidence**.

Dental bonding is a **quick, easy, and affordable treatment** which can conceal these concerns and enhance your smile in a single visit.

***So why should you consider dental bonding at*** [***Gulch Dental Studio***](/)***?***

![Illustration of chipped tooth and bonding]()

## Dental Bonding Offers a Quick and Affordable Way to Enhance Your Smile

### A Cost-Effective Option


### Small or Worn Teeth

Your doctor can use bonding to adjust the size of your teeth. This process can be used for patients whose teeth have been worn down due to clenching or grinding as well as for naturally small teeth.

### Minor Misalignment

Bonding can also conceal small gaps or other types of minor misalignment to make your smile appear more uniform and symmetrical.

### Stubborn Stains

Some types of staining or discoloration are resistant to [teeth whitening](/services/teeth-whitening). Your doctor can perform dental bonding to cover those stains for a brighter, more brilliant smile.

I've heard porcelain veneers are better...

## Our Team Can Help You Weigh Your Options

[Porcelain veneers](/services/veneers) are used to treat many of the same issues as dental bonding. While veneers do offer a more lifelike and durable result, they are also **more expensive than bonding**. In addition, veneers have **additional candidacy requirements** which may prevent you from receiving them.

At our practice, we are dedicated to providing patients with quality dental care that will help them achieve their cosmetic goals. Our team can discuss your options with you and **ensure that you are provided with the best dental solution for your needs**.

![Staff at Gulch Dental Studio]()

Clint Newman, DDS at Gulch Dental Studio

So what actually happens during dental bonding?

## Dental Bonding Is a Simple But Precisely Customized Process

### Treatment Planning

You will first meet with your dentist to discuss your cosmetic goals and concerns. He can use this information to design a personalized treatment plan.

### Color Matching

Your doctor will shade-match the composite resin material to match the surrounding teeth and achieve optimal results.

### Application

Your dentist will gently etch each tooth being treated and apply the resin, carefully molding it to achieve the desired shape and size.


## What is Dental Bonding?

Dental bonding is a cosmetic procedure that conceals imperfections with composite resin, creating the appearance of a fully restored tooth. Composite resin can be shaped and polished to match your surrounding teeth. This material can be used to lengthen teeth, fill gaps, reshape a tooth, or conceal discoloration, and is virtually unnoticeable to others. Composite resin is so durable that our doctors also use it to create [tooth-colored dental fillings](/services/fillings).

![Man with chipped tooth]()

Composite resin can be used to lengthen teeth, fill gaps, or reshape a worn tooth.

## Benefits of Dental Bonding

This procedure offers patients several unique benefits:

- Affordability
- Conservative treatment
- Versatile
- Appropriate for most patients
- Convenient
- Preserves more natural structure of your tooth than other options

This treatment can also be used in conjunction with [restorative procedures](/services/restorative-dentistry) to strengthen teeth. While dental bonding can serve many purposes, it is only a viable solution for minor dental imperfections. Your doctor can provide a complete evaluation to determine whether dental bonding is the right fit for you.

## After Your Procedure

Within the first 48 hours of your treatment, you should avoid dark beverages, cigarettes, and other staining substances. Once this period has passed, your bonded tooth will not require special care. You should, however, avoid biting your nails, chewing on pens, or other hard objects that may chip the material. As long as you continue to practice good oral hygiene and attend [regularly scheduled cleanings and exams](/services/teeth-cleaning), bonding can last for years.

## Our Patient Results

Dental bonding was used to close a small gap between the two front teeth that was detracting from the patient's smile.

### Quality Services

Whether you've chipped a front tooth, knocked out a tooth, or are experiencing another dental emergency, Gulch Dental Studio offers a range of services to restore your oral health and function.

![The Gulch Dental Studio Team]()

![Gulch Dental Studio]()

## Protect Your Oral Health

A dental injury, sudden pain, or a compromised restoration like a veneer or crown are all considered emergencies. Meeting with our emergency dentists in Nashville, TN, can ultimately save your tooth, prevent further damage, and protect your oral health and function. Weâre proud to offer same-day and next-day appointments when our patients need us most.

Nashville patients have grown to trust [Gulch Dental Studio](/) because of our:

- Qualified dentists who prioritize the patient experience
- Advanced technology that aids in comfortable and effective procedures
- Modern and spa-like atmosphere that allows patients to relax and feel at home

If youâre ready to take advantage of all this and more, book your emergency exam at our Nashville dental office today:
## Dental Bonding

Chipped front teeth are unfortunately common. We might recommend [dental bonding](/services/dental-bonding/) to restore the tooth's shape in a quick appointment. If you prefer a more realistic and long-lasting solution, we may recommend a [veneer](/services/veneers/), but the process takes a few weeks.

## Root Canal Therapy

While an infected tooth may need to be extracted, sometimes the tooth can be saved. Our dentists at Gulch Dental Studio will always consider [root canal therapy](/services/root-canal/) to remove an infection from the tooth and preserve the tooth structure before considering extraction.


### Financing Options

If you have out-of-pocket expenses, we accept [financing through CareCreditÂ®](https://www.carecredit.com/go/QWR254). This third-party lender allows patients who qualify to pay for their care in affordable monthly installments.

### Cash and Credit

You can pay for your emergency dentistry procedure with cash or credit cards. We accept American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa, so you can apply cashback or other rewards.

![Gulch Dental Studio waiting area]()

## Sit Back and Relax With Sedation

When youâre stressed about a dental emergency, we donât want you to be worried about pain, too. Our goal is to make your treatment as painless and easy as possible. We accomplish this through the use of:

![Woman cheerful at the dentist]()

### Local Anesthesia

Our dentists can administer local anesthesia, a pain blocker at the treatment site. This numbs the area so any discomfort you feel is minimal.

![Woman sleeping in dental chair]()

### Nitrous Oxide

Nitrous oxide is a mild form of sedation administered through a nose mask. This sedation keeps you calm, but awake throughout your procedure. Nitrous oxide takes effect quickly and is readily available in our office, making it a great option for same-day emergency appointments. The effects of the gas wear off quickly once the nose mask is removed, so patients who receive this form of sedation can drive themselves home after their appointment.

![Woman taking oral sedation]()

### Oral Conscious Sedation

Oral conscious sedation is a prescribed sedative that you take before your appointment. It will help you relax through your procedure, but youâll still be awake. The relaxing effects can last for a few hours, so a trusted friend or family member will have to drive you home after your appointment.

## Nitrous Oxide

The most well-known sedation method in dentistry, nitrous oxide is a clear, odorless gas that can be inhaled through a mask placed over the nose. Nitrous oxide is sometimes called "laughing gas" because it can make patients feel silly and giggly. Nitrous takes effect quickly and wears off quickly, so patients are able to drive themselves home after their treatment.

## Will Insurance Cover Sedation Dentistry?

Sedation dentistry is not usually covered by dental insurance, so you should expect your out-of-pocket expenses to increase if you choose sedation. We want you to have a great experience with dentistry, regardless of your budget, so we'll help you review your insurance plan to see if there are any benefits you can access related to sedation. We also offer financing options that can help you afford sedation dentistry. Contact us for more information about our financing plans.

![Dental crown]()

## Is a Crown Right for Me?

### Sufficient Tooth Structure

In order for a traditional crown to successfully restore your smile, there must be at least one-third of the affected tooth intact. Your dentist will need to gently reshape the tooth before placing the dental restoration.

### Special Requirements for Implants

If you have a single missing tooth, an implant-supported crown can restore the appearance and function of your smile. However, dental implants have a unique set of requirements. Our dentists can determine if you qualify for implant dentistry and coordinate your treatment with a skilled oral surgeon.

## âMy smile looks so good.â

> "I had some crowns replaced and bonding repaired to my front teeth! Dr. Harris did phenomenal work! My smile looks so good. It really helps my confidence. The crowns were quickly replaced and the modern technology allowed them to immediately put them on in one office visit. No need to wait for weeks and suffer with annoying temporary crowns." â Valerie, [5-Star Review](https://g.co/kgs/PQMqds1)

## Why Our Crowns Look Exceptional

At [Gulch Dental Studio](/) in Nashville, TN, we go the extra mile to ensure your comfort and convenience. Our office is equipped with all the most modern restorative technology available in dentistry, and we will always prioritize your individual needs and goals.

![Tweezers holding a dental crown]()

### IPS e.max

Many people equate dental crowns with silver or other metals. Our practice uses metal-free materials like IPS e.max. IPS e.max is a ceramic material, much like porcelain, that provides more natural-looking results than silver or gold. Because it is metal-free, it is a great option for patients with metal sensitivities or allergies. IPS e.max is also durable and feels more like natural tooth enamel. During your first visit, we will review the advantages and disadvantages of the different materials available to you.

![Sirona CEREC equipment]()

### Sirona CEREC

At Gulch Dental Studio, we offer same-day crowns. If your doctor determines you qualify for a same-day crown, we can use our in-office milling machine to craft the restoration while you wait. We use the latest generation of the Sirona CEREC system which offers a range of benefits. With this technology, there's no need for a temporary crown or a second visit. We can also use digital impressions and customize your crown to your exact preferences.

## Making Crowns Last

Taking care of your dental crown is fairly easy. For the most part, you should treat your restoration like you would a natural tooth. However, to ensure your crown lasts for as long as possible, we recommend following these simple instructions:

- ### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

  The best way to maintain your crown and your natural teeth is to practice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth with a soft-bristled toothbrush at least twice a day and floss at least once a day.
- ### Be Careful What You Chew

  While our ceramic and IPS e.max crowns are highly durable, they can still crack under pressure. Refrain from biting down on anything extremely hard or sticky like ice cubes or toffee to prevent damage.
- ### Visit the Dentist

  You should attend a checkup twice a year at our Nashville office to have your teeth professionally examined and cleaned. At this time your dentist will inspect your dental crown and make sure it is in good shape.

## Other Solutions

- ### [Dental Fillings in Nashville, TN](/services/fillings/)

  Small cavities can often be corrected with a dental filling. Fillings preserve your tooth structure and our dentists will always consider this conservative method first before other treatments. If the decay has progressed and is affecting a significant portion of the tooth, a crown may be the best option.
- ### [Tooth Extraction in Nashville, TN](/services/tooth-extraction/)

  Our dentist will always try to save a tooth, but sometimes they're past the point of repair. If you have a painful tooth that's putting your oral health at risk, our team will use gentle methods to extract it. We can then explore options to replace the tooth to restore your bite and keep the surrounding teeth in place.

![man getting dental work]()


We refer patients to a trusted oral surgeon in the area to place [dental implants in Nashville, TN](/services/dental-implants/). Once the implant is ready, you can return to our office where we'll take impressions and create a custom crown with maximum stability. Your replacement will look, feel, and function just like your natural teeth.

[(615) 953-3068](tel:6159533068)

![Implant-supported crown on concrete]()

## Dental Crown FAQ

### Does getting a  dental crown hurt?

No; while you may feel some pressure or sensitivity, thanks to modern dentistry getting a crown is virtually painless. You will be numbed using a local anesthetic before your dentist begins treatment. For those who need an extra level of comfort or for those with dental phobia or anxiety, our Nashville practice offers [multiple forms of sedation](/services/sedation-dentistry) to ensure the most comfortable and positive dental experience possible.

### Why not just pull  a damaged tooth?

Many patients often ask if [extracting a damaged tooth](/services/tooth-extraction) is better or more affordable than a crown. The short answer is no. While it may seem like a quick solution, preserving a tooth is always best. Your jawbone can deteriorate without the stimulation tooth roots provide. What's more, a missing tooth lets nearby teeth shift position. By treating a damaged tooth with a dental crown, you can preserve the tooth structure. Extractions are only done when saving the tooth is not an option.

### Will my crown ever  need to be replaced?

Even the best materials will wear over time and will eventually need to be replaced. However, with proper maintenance, your dental crown can last for 10 years or longer. Practice good oral health habits like brushing and flossing and getting [routine dental cleanings](/services/teeth-cleaning) to keep your crown looking its best. If you grind your teeth, your dentist may suggest a night guard to prevent wear to your dental crown and natural teeth.

## "In and out in under two hours."

> "Dr. Harris and his hygienist Hannah are amazing. Had an appointment for a crown and I was in and out in under 2 hours. They were caring, funny, and always worrying so I didnât have to. Thank you! âºï¸" â Steve, [5-Star Review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UAp1iJXjtFvsogcq8)

## The Process of Invisalign Treatment at Our Nashville, TN, Practice

> Each patient's smile is unique, so each treatment plan will be personalized to their needs.

> Each patient's smile is unique, so each treatment plan will be personalized to their needs.

### Assessment and Imaging

Your dentist will evaluate your overall oral health, then take a series of X-rays, photographs, and impressions of your teeth.

### Planning Treatment

Based on your examination and imaging, your dentist can design a custom orthodontic treatment plan. They will then work with the aligner software to develop your clear aligners.

### Receive Your Aligners

Once the aligners are created, you will wear them in stages based on your dentist's recommendation. Because your teeth will be shifting differently with each aligner set, you will periodically visit our office so your dentist can see how you are progressing.

### Enjoy Your New Smile

Once you reach the end of the series of aligners, no more aligners are needed. However, just like with braces, you will need to wear a retainer to keep your teeth in place.

[Request Your Orthodontic Consultation](tel:+16159533068)

## How to Care for Your Clear Aligners

Maintaining routine dental care and [dental checkups](/services/teeth-cleaning) is always the first step in keeping your teeth and gums healthy. Below are more ways to ensure your teeth and aligners remain functional and clean:

### Clean Your Invisalign Trays When You Brush Your Teeth

Clean your trays each time you brush and floss your teeth. The best way to clean your aligners is by using the Invisalign Cleaning System. However, denture cleaner is another great way to clean your aligners without damaging them. Do not use extremely hot or cold water when cleaning trays: extreme temperatures can warp the shape, making them ineffective.

### Rinse After Eating

Don't let anything â especially food particles and bacteria â get between your teeth and your aligners. Since Invisalign clear aligners are removable, be sure to rinse your mouth well with lukewarm water before putting your aligners back in after eating. When possible, brushing your teeth before wearing your aligners is even better.

### Know When to Remove Your Aligner

Drinking things like sodas, coffee, and alcoholic beverages while wearing Invisalign means those acids and sugars will sit on your teeth until you remove the aligner. This can cause oral health issues, such as cavities and staining. If you are consuming something besides water, be sure to remove Invisalign first, and then brush your teeth once you're done.

### Easier to Clean


### Will I need to wear retainers after?

We recommend wearing retainers after any orthodontics treatment, whether that be Invisalign or traditional braces. Wearing a retainer after you're done with your series of custom Invisalign trays prevents your teeth from gradually shifting out of alignment. However, every case is unique; we'll walk you through what you can expect following treatment.

## Ready for an Even More Youthful Appearance?

A straighter smile is just one step towards an overall younger look. That is why our Nashville, TN, office proudly offers BOTOXÂ® Cosmetic. Reducing laugh lines and crows' feet can complement your newly straightened smile for powerful rejuvenation.

## What Are Porcelain Veneers?

A porcelain veneer, also called a dental veneer, is an ultra-thin shell that our [dentist in Nashville, TN](/), can attach to the surface of a tooth. Once bonded to the tooth, veneers obscure cosmetic concerns like chips, cracks, or stains. Each shell is made from porcelain or similar materials that flawlessly resemble the appearance of a natural tooth.

Porcelain veneers have become one of the most popular treatment options in cosmetic dentistry because they are relatively easy to place and yield exceptional lifelike results.

## Are Veneers Covered by Dental Insurance?

/

No. As a cosmetic dentistry procedure, dental veneers are considered an elective treatment rather than medically necessary. Thankfully, our [financing options](/patient-forms) can keep veneer treatment affordable for many households. We can also go over cheaper alternative treatments that may be right for you.

## Concerned About the Cost of Veneers? Financing Options Are Available for Your Dental Work

## Working Within Your Budget

Our doctors want to make the **life-changing, long-lasting benefits of veneers**accessible to as many patients as possible. We will work closely with you to design a treatment that suits your needs, budget, and end goals.

## Keeping Dental Care Affordable

Veneers are cosmetic and not covered by insurance. To make treatment more affordable, **we accept [CareCreditÂ®](https://www.carecredit.com/go/QWR254),** a third-party financing option that offers low-interest and interest-free repayment plans.

## Don't Settle for an Imperfect Smile Contact Gulch Dental Studio Today


[Contact Us to Experience the Gulch Dental Studio Difference](/contact)
Clenching or grinding your teeth can damage restorations like veneers. An oral appliance or another treatment for these issues may allow you to still undergo treatment.


### Fabrication:

Once we decide on specifics like color and shape, we will send your impressions to a trusted dental lab. In the meantime, you will receive temporary veneers that still allow you to chew and speak normally. Follow our instructions for proper care of these temporary veneers.

### Placement:

Before placing your veneers, your dentist will test them for fit and aesthetics. Your dentist will then remove the temporary veneers and clean each prepared tooth with a cleansing solution designed to aid in the bonding process. The bonding agent is then applied to your teeth, and the dentist will secure your final veneers in place.

## Life After Veneers

/

One of the greatest benefits of veneers is that you can begin to enjoy the results almost immediately. There is virtually no recovery or downtime needed, and your veneers will be ready to show off as soon as you leave our downtown Nashville dental office.

## Caring for Porcelain Veneers Is Simple MAINTAIN THE BEAUTY OF YOUR ENHANCED SMILE

Though we use durable, high-quality materials, veneers will still need to be replaced at some point. Excellent oral hygiene and continued care of your teeth and gums can extend the lifespan of your veneers.

## Brush and Floss Regularly

You should continue good oral hygiene habits like brushing twice daily and flossing at least once daily. Maintaining the health of your teeth and gums is one of the best ways to ensure the longevity of your porcelain veneers.

## Attend Routine Dental Visits

Coming to our office in the Gulch twice a year for [routine cleanings](/services/teeth-cleaning) will help maintain the health of your teeth and gums as well as extend the lifespan of your veneers and any other new restorations.

## Avoid Biting Hard Surfaces

While the porcelain material we use is highly durable, it is not indestructible. You should avoid chewing on ice, biting your nails, nibbling on pens, and opening packaging with your teeth. These actions can chip or damage your veneers.

## Avoid Teeth Grinding

Veneers can be used to treat minor tooth misalignment, but sometimes orthodontics is the better option. This ensures your teeth look straight and can prevent oral health problems such as teeth grinding and TMJ disorders.

Gulch Dental Studios offers Invisalign instead of traditional metal braces. Thanks to the clear plastic aligner trays used during the months-long procedure, you can complete Invisalign treatment without anyone noticing you're undergoing orthodontic care.

[Discuss Your Options with a Cosmetic Dentist](/consultation)
You technically can smoke or use chewing tobacco after getting dental veneers, but it's a bad idea. The veneers will not become stained, but tobacco products will discolor your natural teeth and increase your risk of [gum disease](/services/periodontics). We often tell patients that getting dental veneers is a convenient excuse to kick their smoking or chewing tobacco habit for good.

### What should I do if a veneer gets chipped or comes loose?

If a dental veneer is fractured or somehow gets dislodged, it's important that you contact our Nashville practice as soon as possible. Bring the debonded veneer or broken fragment with you if possible. Our dental team can assess the issue and determine the most effective treatment for this dental veneer problem.

### Why are veneers from veneer techs so cheap?

Veneers from veneer techs are cheap because veneer techs are not licensed dental care professionals. In fact, their work is illegal and potentially dangerous. All it takes to be a veneer tech is a little training for a meaningless certificate. Veneer techs also use substandard tools and materials when doing their dental work. There is a risk of lasting tooth damage and poor cosmetic results. This is why it's worth spending extra money to get your dental veneers from an experienced and qualified cosmetic dentist.

[Oral surgery](/services/oral-surgery) includes a diverse range of treatments, from complex tooth extraction to TMJ repair. Patients who choose [dental implants](/services/dental-implants) undergo a surgical procedure to place the titanium posts in the jawbone, and your doctor can perform bone grafts if the jaw needs to be strengthened. We can refer patients to trusted local physicians, as needed.
