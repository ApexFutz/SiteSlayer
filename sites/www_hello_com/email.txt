SUBJECT: Making your next launch even friendlier with instant site answers

-----------------------------------------
Hi hello team,

I love how your site emphasizes community and staying connected, even during your pause. As you gear up for your next chapter, I wanted to share a simple way to welcome visitors and keep them in the loop right from your website.

At SlayDigital.ai, we create easy-to-use, custom AI chat agents that live on your site and let visitors get quick answers using the information you already share. No jargon—just a friendly way to help people feel at home.

To show what this could look like for hello, here’s a mock version of your site with a demo agent: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_hello_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, ask any question, and you’ll get answers based on your site content.

You can try asking things like:
- When will hello relaunch?
- What’s changing in the new version?
- How can I stay updated on the launch?
- Will my previous account or data be saved?
- Is hello available in multiple languages?

If you think something like this could fit your next big reveal, I’d be happy to chat or set up a quick call whenever you’re ready.

Best,  
Zac
