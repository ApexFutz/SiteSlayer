Hi Dr. McNutt,

I appreciate how welcoming and informative Richland Creek Family Dentistry is—especially for new patients who are looking for both trust and clarity.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents for websites like yours, making it easier for people to get quick answers from your own site content, day or night. The idea is to help your team spend less time fielding repetitive questions, while giving patients instant guidance whenever they need it.

I set up a mock version of your site you can try here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/richlandcreekdentistry_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, type a question, and see how the agent responds using your existing site info.

You can try asking things like:
- What does the in-office savings plan cover?
- Do you accept my dental insurance?
- How do I book an emergency appointment?
- What sedation options are available if I have dental anxiety?
- When are your earliest available appointments?

Would you be interested in a quick chat about how this could help streamline common questions for you and your team? No pressure—just wanted to show you what’s possible.

Best,  
Zac
