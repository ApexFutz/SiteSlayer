SUBJECT: A simple way to help Wikipedia visitors find answers (and donate!)

Hello Wikipedia team,

I know you have a lot on your plate—especially during fundraising time! At SlayDigital.ai, we create simple, custom AI chat agents that help website visitors quickly find the answers they need by interacting with your existing content.

We set up a quick mock version of your homepage: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_wikipedia_org  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to ask questions—no extra installation or content updates needed.

You can try asking things like:  
• How can I donate to Wikipedia?  
• What does my donation support?  
• Is my donation tax-deductible?  
• Can I set up a recurring monthly donation?  
• How is Wikipedia funded?

Our agents help reduce repetitive questions and guide visitors directly to the info (and donation links!) they’re looking for. If you think this could be useful, I’d love to chat for a few minutes and hear your thoughts.

Best,  
Zac Slay
