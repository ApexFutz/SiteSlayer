SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Answers Faster at East Nashville Family Dentistry

Hi there,

I was just exploring East Nashville Family Dentistry’s site and loved how clearly you outline your services and your focus on making care accessible for families in Nashville.

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that sit right on your website, making it easy for visitors to get instant answers from your existing content—without any tech headaches for your team.

We put together a quick demo for your site here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/enfdentistry_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right and type a question—your agent replies using your own site info.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I book a same-day emergency appointment?
- What’s the difference between dentures and dental implants?
- Do you offer Invisalign or other braces?
- Are you currently accepting new patients?

Would love to hear if this could save your staff time and make life easier for your patients. If you’re interested, just reply and I can share more details.

Best,  
Zac
