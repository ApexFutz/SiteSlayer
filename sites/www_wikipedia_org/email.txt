SUBJECT: Helping Wikipedia Visitors Find Answers Instantly—Quick Demo Inside

-----------------------------------------

Hi team,

I’m a longtime admirer of how Wikipedia simplifies access to knowledge in hundreds of languages. I noticed your users often land on the portal page with questions about language versions, donations, or how to get started.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI chat agents that live on your site and answer visitor questions directly from your existing content—no jargon, no complexity. To show what this could look like for Wikipedia, I created a quick demo:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_wikipedia_org

Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right corner, type a question, and the agent responds using info from your live portal.

You can try asking things like:
- “How can I donate to Wikipedia?”
- “Which languages have the most articles?”
- “What’s the average donation amount?”
- “How do I read Wikipedia in Japanese?”
- “Where can I buy Wikipedia merchandise?”

I’d love your thoughts on whether a tool like this could help users find key info and support your mission—even during busy fundraising periods. No pressure, but let me know if you’re interested in a real trial or feedback.

Best,  
Zac
