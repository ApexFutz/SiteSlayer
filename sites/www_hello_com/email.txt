SUBJECT: Simple way to help visitors connect with hello network at launch

Hi there,

I saw you're preparing for the upcoming launch of hello network—exciting times!

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple chat agents that live right on your site, letting visitors get instant answers from your own content. It's a great way to welcome early users and cut down on repetitive questions as you grow.

I set up a quick demo using your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_hello_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner; just click it to start chatting with a friendly AI agent that already knows your site info.

You can try asking things like:
- “When will hello network be launching?”
- “How do I join the waitlist?”
- “What features will be available at launch?”
- “Is there a way to sign up in Portuguese?”
- “Who is hello network for?”

If you’re curious how this could support your launch, let me know—always happy to chat, no pressure.

Best,  
Zac
