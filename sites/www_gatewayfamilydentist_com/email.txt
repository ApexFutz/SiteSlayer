SUBJECT: See how a simple AI chat agent could help clarify your dental services

Hi there,

I noticed your website, and wanted to share a quick idea—at SlayDigital.ai, we build simple AI-powered website agents that help visitors quickly find info by chatting directly with your site content.

To show how this could work for Gateway Family Dentist, we set up a quick demo here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_gatewayfamilydentist_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type a question; the agent will answer based on information already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What dental insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I book a first appointment?
- What are your hours and location?
- Do you offer teeth whitening or other cosmetic services?
- Is emergency dentistry available?

I’d be happy to hear your thoughts or answer any questions if you’re curious—no pressure at all!

Best,
