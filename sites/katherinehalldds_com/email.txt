SUBJECT: Helping patients find answers faster on your dental website

Hi there,

I noticed your practice’s contact info is front and center—super helpful for patients who want to reach out directly. We work with dental offices like yours at SlayDigital.ai, building easy-to-use AI chat agents that sit quietly on your website and answer common patient questions using only your existing site info.

I’ve set up a simple demo for you here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/katherinehalldds_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right, type a question, and get a quick answer based on your own site content.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How can I schedule an appointment as a new patient?
- Where is your office located and what are your hours?
- What dental services do you offer?
- What should I bring to my first appointment?

If you think something like this could save you time or help your patients, I’d love to show you more or answer any questions—no pressure.

Best,  
Zac Slay
