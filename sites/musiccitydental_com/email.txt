SUBJECT: Helping New Patients Feel at Ease on the Music City Dental Website

Hi Dr. Spurlin-Moore and Music City Dental team,

I love how your site emphasizes both patient comfort and education—it’s clear you go above and beyond to make every visit relaxing, especially for those with dental anxiety.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple AI-powered web agents that embed on your site and help visitors quickly get answers based on your existing content. This makes it easy for new and returning patients to find the info they need—no jargon, no fuss.

We created a quick demo using a mock version of your website at https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/musiccitydental_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right—click it to open a chat where you can type any question. The agent responds using what’s already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What does the Priority Care Membership Club include and how much does it cost?
- Do you offer sedation dentistry for anxious patients?
- What services are available for new patients or those without insurance?
- How do I book an appointment or submit new patient forms?
- What technology do you use for dental procedures?

If this kind of tool could help streamline questions or make your site even more welcoming, I’d be glad to chat. No pressure—just let me know if you’d like to see how it works on your live site!

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
