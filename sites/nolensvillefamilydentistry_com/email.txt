SUBJECT: Helping Nolensville families find quick answers—see your site’s new chat agent demo

Hello Nolensville Family Dentistry team,

I appreciate the inviting, personal touch you bring to serving families in Nolensville—it really comes through across your site.

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI agents that live right on your website, ready to help patients find answers 24/7. No complicated tech—just a friendly chat assistant that uses your existing website information to answer common questions and help visitors feel more confident reaching out.

To show how this could work for you, we set up a quick demo using your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nolensvillefamilydentistry_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open a chat box, where you can type a question and get an immediate answer based on your site content.

You might try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I schedule my first appointment?
- What should I bring as a new patient?
- What dental services do you offer for children?
- What are your office hours?

Our goal is to make it easier for your patients to get the details they need, so your team can focus more on care and less on repetitive inquiries.

If this is something you’d like to explore, I’d be happy to chat or answer any questions.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay  
Founder, SlayDigital.ai
