SUBJECT: Helping New Patients Feel Right at Home on Your Website

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Adamson,

I’ve been exploring Nolensville Family Dentistry’s website, and it’s obvious how much heart goes into making every patient feel welcome and cared for—just like an extended dental family.

I wanted to introduce SlayDigital.ai. We build custom, simple AI chat agents that can help visitors find answers on your website 24/7—without replacing your team’s warmth or personal touch.

To show how this could work for your practice, I’ve set up a mock version of your site with a demo chat agent here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nolensvillefamilydentistry_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner; click it to open the chat and ask questions your patients might have—the agent replies using your existing site info.

You can try asking things like:
- What do I need to bring as a new patient?
- Which dental insurance plans do you accept?
- What dental services do you offer for kids?
- What are your office hours and how do I schedule an appointment?
- Do you offer teeth whitening or cosmetic treatments?

I hope this makes it even easier for new and returning patients to feel right at home. If you’re interested in seeing how this could fit your practice, I’d be happy to chat—no pressure at all.

Warm regards,  
Zac  
Founder, SlayDigital.ai
