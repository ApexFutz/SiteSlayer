Hi Dr. Spurlin-Moore,

I came across Music City Dental and was really impressed by your focus on a relaxing, patient-centered experience in Nashville. Your Priority Care Membership and commitment to using the latest technology truly stand out.

I’m reaching out from SlayDigital.ai—my team builds simple AI chat agents that help visitors find clear answers to their questions right from your website, using the information you already provide. This is designed to reduce repetitive calls and make it easier for new patients to get comfortable before they walk in.

I put together a quick example using a mock version of your website here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/musiccitydental_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the box, then type any question—your custom agent will reply immediately with information from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “How does your Priority Care Membership work and what’s included?”
- “Do you accept new patients without insurance?”
- “What dental technologies do you use?”
- “How do I schedule an appointment or fill out forms?”
- “What should I expect at my first visit?”

If you’re curious how this might help your team support patients and streamline common questions, just let me know. I’d be happy to chat when you have a moment—no pressure, just a conversation.

Warm regards,  
Zac
