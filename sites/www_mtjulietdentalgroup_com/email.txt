SUBJECT: Help Patients Find Dental Answers Instantly on Your Website

Hi there,

I’m reaching out because Mt Juliet Dental Group stands out for providing clear information and compassionate care at every step—from first visits to advanced technology and flexible payment options.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple AI web agents that live right on your website, helping your patients get instant answers using info you’ve already shared online. No jargon—just clarity and fewer phone interruptions for your team.

You can see a live example for your site here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_mtjulietdentalgroup_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type a question—the agent responds with accurate, up-to-date info from your site.

Try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I book a same-day or emergency appointment?
- What’s included in the $59 New Patient Special?
- How does Smile Generation Dental Plan work?
- How can I pay my bill or access my records online?

If helping patients find answers faster (and lightening your staff’s load) is of interest, I’d love your quick thoughts or questions.

Thanks for your time,  
Zac Slay
