SUBJECT: Helping Visitors Find the Right Wikipedia in Seconds

Hi there,

I know Wikipedia’s mission is all about making free knowledge accessible to everyone, in every language. To support that, I wanted to show you a simple way to help people quickly find the right version of Wikipedia or answer their most frequent questions—without sifting through pages or menus.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build custom web chat agents that let visitors ask questions directly on your site and get instant answers based on your existing content—no jargon or extra complexity.

Here's a quick demo, using a mock version of your homepage: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_wikipedia_org. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right to open the chat box and ask away—no setup needed.

You can try asking things like:
- “How do I find Wikipedia in my language?”
- “Where can I donate to support Wikipedia?”
- “How many articles are available in Spanish?”
- “Do I get any benefits if I donate?”
- “What’s the difference between one-time and monthly donations?”

If you think this could help newcomers or donors get clarity faster, I’d be happy to share more or set up a quick test with your actual site.

Best wishes,
Zac Slay
