SUBJECT: Helping Lifetime Dentistry Patients Get Answers Instantly

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Hernandez,

I’ve really enjoyed seeing how Lifetime Dentistry blends advanced technology (like CEREC and 3D imaging) with genuine, patient-centered care—it’s clear you go the extra mile for your patients.

I wanted to share something very simple that could help your visitors get answers quickly and reduce repetitive calls to your front desk: custom AI web agents. At SlayDigital.ai, we build chat agents that live right on your website and answer questions directly using the info already on your site—no extra setup or complicated integrations.

To show what this could look like, I made a quick example using your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/lifetimedentistrytn_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat box, then type a question—your agent will answer using your own site content.

You might try asking:
- What options do you offer for missing teeth?
- Can you tell me about your dental implant process?
- Do you provide emergency dental services?
- How do clear aligners work at Lifetime Dentistry?
- What technology do you use for same-day crowns?

I think this could make it even easier for your patients to get the information they need, when they need it, and free up your team for higher-value conversations.

If you’d like to see how this could fit into your workflow, just let me know—happy to answer any questions or chat further.

Warm regards,  
Zac
