SUBJECT: Making Your Dental Practice Website Easier for New & Existing Patients

Hi there,

I came across Katherine Hall DDS and noticed how welcoming your Nashville practice looks. At SlayDigital.ai, we help dental offices like yours make it even easier for patients to get answers right on your website—without adding complexity for your team.

We’ve put together a quick demo for your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/katherinehalldds_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right—just click it, type a question, and the agent will respond using the information currently on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What services do you offer?
- How do I book a first appointment?
- What’s the difference between the existing and new patient numbers?
- Where are you located and what are your office hours?
- Do you accept my insurance?

If you’re curious how this could reduce routine calls and help patients get the info they need faster, I’d be glad to answer any questions or set up a quick call.

Best,  
Zac Slay
