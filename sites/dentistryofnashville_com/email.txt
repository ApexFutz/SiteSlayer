SUBJECT: Helping Nashville Smile—Try a Custom Chat Agent for Your Website

-----------------------------------------

Hi Lori,

I love how Dentistry of Nashville blends family tradition with top-notch technology—it’s clear why patients keep coming back, generation after generation.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours reduce repetitive questions and make it even easier for new and returning patients to find the information they need right on your website, with a friendly, custom AI chat agent.

To show you what this looks like, we built a quick mockup using your own site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/dentistryofnashville_com  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right, type a question, and the agent will reply instantly with answers pulled straight from your site content.

You can try asking things like:  
• What makes Dentistry of Nashville different from other local practices?  
• How does CEREC same-day crown technology work?  
• What is the process for getting dental implants?  
• What should I expect at my first visit?  
• Do you offer LANAP laser gum treatment?

Would you be interested in seeing how a tool like this could help your team spend less time answering repeat questions—and more time caring for your patients? If so, I’d be happy to chat or give you a quick demo.

Warm regards,  
Zac
