We owe you an explanation.

An important update for readers in the United States.

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. This fundraiser will soon be over, but we haven't yet hit our goal. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promisedâcreated by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Just 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.

Please select an amount (USD).
The average donation in the United States is around $13. Many first-time donors give $2.75. All that matters is that you're choosing to stand up for free, open information; and for that, you have our gratitude.

### Sorry to interrupt, but we're short on time to hit our goal.

Today, we ask you to join the 2% of readers who give. If everyone reading this right now gave just $2.75, we'd hit our goal quickly. $2.75 is all we ask.
