Hi Mt Juliet Dental Group team,

Your commitment to making dental visits easy, transparent, and stress-free really stands out. I noticed how many helpful resources you offer—whether it’s insurance info, the Smile Generation plans, or clear guides on what to expect at a first visit.

I’m reaching out from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI agents that live right on your website, helping visitors quickly find the answers they need—using your own content, not generic scripts.

Here’s a mock demo we made just for you:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_mtjulietdentalgroup_com  
Click the chat icon in the bottom right, open the box, and type any question—your new virtual assistant will respond instantly using real info from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- Do you accept Delta Dental insurance?
- What’s included in the $59 new patient special?
- How does CEREC same-day crowns work?
- How do I prepare for my first visit?
- What payment and financing options are available?

This is a concrete way to cut down on repetitive calls, help new patients feel confident, and make sure everyone finds the right info fast. If you’d like to talk about how this could work for your website, just let me know—I’d be happy to help.

Best,  
Zac
