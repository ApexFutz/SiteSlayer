SUBJECT: A Helpful Way for Visitors to Get Quick Answers at The Clay Lady’s Campus

-----------------------------------------

Hi Danielle,

I love how The Clay Lady’s Campus brings together artists, students, and the Nashville community—it’s clear that you’ve created a place where creativity and learning truly thrive.

I wanted to share a new way to make your website’s wealth of information even more accessible: at SlayDigital.ai, we build simple AI chat agents that help your website visitors find answers quickly, without the hassle of digging through menus or waiting for a reply. These agents can answer common questions using details already on your site.

I put together a mock version of your homepage with a demo agent:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/theclaylady_com  
To try it, just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner. A box will pop up where you can type any question, and the agent will respond with clear info right from your own content.

You can try asking things like:
- When do class registrations open, and how do I get on the waitlist?
- What kinds of workshops are available for beginners or families?
- How do I visit The CLC Gallery and tour artist studios?
- What are the steps for first-time students signing up for classes?
- Where can I buy Opulence Glaze or The Clay Lady’s Lesson Book?

A tool like this can help answer frequent questions 24/7, guide newcomers, and free up your staff to focus on what matters most: teaching and building community.

If you think this could help your students or visitors, I’d be happy to talk more or customize a version for The Clay Lady’s Campus.

Wishing you all the best (and lots of muddy hands!),
Zac
