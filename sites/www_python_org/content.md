## PAGE: Python For Beginners | Python.org

**Source URL:** https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/
**Link Text:** Start with our Beginner's Guide
**File:** about_gettingstarted.md

Welcome! Are you [completely new to programming](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)?
If _not_ then we presume you will be looking for information about
why and how to get started with Python.
Fortunately an
experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be)
can pick up Python very quickly.
It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so
[jump in](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)!

# Installing

Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays
many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python.
Even
some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python
already installed.
If you _do_ need to install Python and aren't confident about the
task you can find
a few notes on the
[BeginnersGuide/Download](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.

# Learning

Before getting started, you may want to find out which [IDEs](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) and [text
editors](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) are tailored to make
Python editing easy, browse the list of [introductory books](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks), or look at [code samples](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples) that you might find
helpful.

There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the
[BeginnersGuide/Tutorials](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)
page. There is also a list of
[resources in other languages](/doc/nonenglish/)
which might be useful if English is not your first language.

The [online documentation](http://docs.python.org)
is your first port of call for definitive information.
There is a fairly brief
[tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
that gives you basic information about the language and
gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the
[library reference](http://docs.python.org/3/library/)
for a full description of Python's many libraries and the
[language reference](http://docs.python.org/3/reference/) for
a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax.
If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you
can browse the [ActiveState Python Cookbook](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/)

# Looking for Something Specific?

If you want to know whether a particular application, or a library
with particular functionality, is available in Python there are a
number of possible sources of information. The Python web site
provides a
[Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=index)
(also known as the _Cheese Shop_, a reference to the Monty Python
script of that name).
There is also a
[search page](/search) for a number of sources of Python-related
information. Failing that, just
[Google](http://www.google.com) for a phrase including the word ''python''
and you may well get the result you need.
If all else fails, ask on the
[python newsgroup](news:comp.lang.python)
and there's a good chance someone will put you on the right track.

# Frequently Asked Questions

If you have a question, it's a good idea to try the
[FAQ](http://docs.python.org/3/faq/), which answers the most commonly
asked questions about Python.

# Looking to Help?

If you want to help to develop Python, take a look at the
[developer area](/dev/) for further information.
Please note that you don't have to be an expert programmer
to help. The documentation is just as important as the
compiler, and still needs plenty of work!
