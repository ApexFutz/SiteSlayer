SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Help Mt Juliet Dental Group Visitors Get Answers—Instantly

Hi there,

I’ve been exploring the Mt Juliet Dental Group website, and it’s clear your team puts a lot of care into educating and guiding patients, whether it’s about CEREC® same-day crowns, insurance, or what to expect from advanced technologies like CBCT imaging. With so much helpful info available, I wanted to share something you might find valuable.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build custom, super-simple chat agents that sit quietly on your site—helping visitors quickly find answers from your own content, 24/7. No confusing tech speak or bots pretending to be dentists—just a fast way to reduce repetitive phone calls and make it easier for patients to get connected or book.

You can see a live demo on a mock version of your site here:

Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right, type any question, and the agent will answer using your existing website info.

You can try asking things like:
- “Do you offer same-day dental crowns with CEREC?”
- “Which insurance plans are accepted?”
- “How much does teeth whitening cost?”
- “What’s the process for scheduling a dental emergency visit?”
- “Are veneers covered by insurance at your office?”

If you think this kind of instant Q&A could make your team’s day easier or help your patients take the next step, I’d love to hear what you think—zero pressure.

Best,  
Zac Slay
