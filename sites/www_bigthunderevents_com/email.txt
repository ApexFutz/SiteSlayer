SUBJECT: Make Big Thunder Events Even Easier for Customers—See Our Demo on Your Site

Hi Tony and Kacey,

I was inspired by the community spirit and hands-on service you bring to Big Thunder Events—it’s no wonder you have so many loyal school, church, and family clients.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build custom, easy-to-use AI chat agents that let your website visitors ask questions about your rentals, booking, or logistics and instantly get clear answers—using the info already on your site.

To show how this could work for Big Thunder Events, we set up a quick demo:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_bigthunderevents_com

Just click the chat icon at the bottom right and type a question; the agent will reply with details from your actual content.

You can try asking things like:
- How do I book a bounce house or water slide?
- What’s included in your delivery/setup? Are travel fees extra?
- Which rentals are best for a school field day or church carnival?
- Do you offer multi-unit discounts for schools and nonprofits?
- What are your setup requirements and what surfaces can you install on?

This tool is designed to reduce repetitive questions, help customers plan faster, and let your team focus on what you do best. No tech headaches or AI jargon—just useful, practical help for your visitors.

If you’re curious about making customer support even smoother (especially during busy seasons), I’d love to chat or hear your feedback.

Best,  
Zac Slay
