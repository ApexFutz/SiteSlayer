SUBJECT: Make Your Dental Answers Even Easier for New and Returning Patients

-----------------------------------------
Hi there,

I’ve been browsing East Nashville Family Dentistry’s site and love how welcoming and thorough your care descriptions are. From general exams to Invisalign and same-day emergencies, you really make it easy for patients in Nashville to feel at home.

I run SlayDigital.ai, where we build simple chat agents that help website visitors get answers from your own site content—without hunting through menus or sending multiple emails.

To show you what I mean, I created a quick demo with your site’s information:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/enfdentistry_com

There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner—just click it to open a chat box and type a question. The agent replies using info already on your website.

You can try asking things like:
- Do you accept my insurance or offer payment plans?
- What’s included in a regular cleaning and how often should I come in?
- How does Invisalign work and is it right for adults?
- How soon can I book an emergency appointment?
- What are the steps for getting dental implants?

I think a tool like this could save your staff time on routine questions, while helping patients feel supported and confident right from their first visit.

If you’re curious to see if this could fit into your workflow, just reply—no strings attached.

Wishing you and your team continued success,  
Zac
