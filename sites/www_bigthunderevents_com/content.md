# 🎉 Frequently Asked Questions – Big Thunder Events 🎉

## 🎪 Top 5 Things to Look for When Choosing an Inflatable or Carnival Rental

[⚡ Experience That Delivers](#accn23at_0_collapseOne)

Look for a company that’s been tested by time, not just trending.  
**Big Thunder Events has been serving Middle Tennessee since 2005**, handling everything from backyard birthdays to corporate festivals. We’ve seen it all, solved it all, and brought the fun every step of the way.

[🛠️ Licensed, Insured & Professionally Staffed](#accn23at_0_collapseTwo)

[What areas do you serve?](#accn3at_0_collapseOne)

Big Thunder Events proudly serves **Nashville, Murfreesboro, Franklin, Brentwood, Smyrna**, and most of **Middle Tennessee**. If you're within about an hour of Murfreesboro, there's a good chance we deliver to you.

**For larger events or full event management**, we’re happy to travel further.

[Do prices include delivery and setup?](#accn3at_0_collapseTwo)

Our rental prices include **professional setup and takedown** of your equipment. However, **a travel fee** is added based on your event location. This covers fuel, crew time, and logistics.

You’ll always receive a **detailed quote with all fees included** before confirming your reservation—**no surprises**.

Need a quick estimate? Call us at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) and we’ll be happy to help.

[How far in advance should I book?](#accn3at_0_collapseThree)

We recommend booking **as early as possible**, especially for **weekends, school field days, church events, and large festivals**.

Spring and summer dates fill up fast, and popular items are often reserved **weeks—even months—in advance**.  
That said, if your event is coming up soon, give us a call—we’ll do our best to make it happen!

📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[**info@bigthunderevents.com**](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[Can I rent multiple inflatables for one event?](#accn3at_0_collapseFour)

Yes! In fact, **many of our clients rent multiple inflatables or attractions** for school field days, church festivals, corporate events, and large parties.

We also offer **multi-unit discounts** for **schools, churches, and nonprofits**, so you can get more fun for your budget.

Not sure what combos work best together? Give us a call at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867), and we’ll help you build the perfect event lineup.

📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[**info@bigthunderevents.com**](mailto: info@bigthunderevents.com?subject=Event%20staffing)**

## ⚡ Power & Setup Requirements

[What kind of power is required?](#accn14at_0_collapseOne)

Each inflatable requires **one or more blowers**, and **each blower must have its own dedicated 20-amp circuit**, not just a separate outlet. Most outlets in homes or parks are linked to the same circuit, so plugging into two nearby plugs could still **overload and trip the breaker**.

We provide up to **100 feet of commercial-grade extension cord per blower**.

Not sure if your setup can handle it? **Just ask!** Or skip the guesswork and **rent one of our [generators](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/items/generator/?ssq=GENERATOR)** to keep everything running smoothly.  
📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[**info@bigthunderevents.com**](mailto: info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[Can you set up on concrete, turf, or indoors?](#accn14at_0_collapseTwo)

Yes! We can set up on **grass, turf, concrete, asphalt, gym floors, or indoors**. Just let us know your surface type when booking so we can bring the right anchoring equipment (like **sandbags or water barrels** instead of stakes).

> 🚫 **Please note:** We do **not** set up on **gravel, loose rock, or aggregate driveways**, as these surfaces can damage the equipment and create safety issues.

Have questions about your setup area? We’ll help you plan a safe and smooth event!   
📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[How much space is needed for setup?](#accn14at_0_collapseThree)

Each inflatable or ride has its own size requirements, but as a general rule, we recommend **at least 2 feet of clearance on all sides**, including **overhead clearance** for tall slides or games. You can find exact measurements listed in each unit’s description.

If you’re unsure whether your space will work, just ask!  
And don’t forget, we also need room for **setup access**, especially for larger rides or obstacle courses.

Need help planning your layout? We offer **on-site walk-throughs for an additional fee**. Or **Give us a call or email us and we’ll walk you through the process:**  
📞[**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[What power is required for Mechanical/Carnival rides?](#accn14at_0_collapseFour)

We **provide power for all mechanical and carnival rides** as part of your rental. However, most of these attractions require a **50-amp RV-style outlet** to operate safely and reliably.

If your location doesn't have the correct outlet available, don’t worry—we’ll bring a **generator setup** to power the ride. Our team will go over all power needs with you during the booking process to ensure everything runs smoothly.

📞 **Have questions about power access?** Give us a call at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)** and we’ll walk you through the details.

[what are the Setup & Site Requirements?](#accn14at_0_collapseFive)

To ensure a smooth and safe event, here’s what we need for setup:

✅ **Flat, clear space** — free of debris, holes, sharp objects, or overhead obstructions (like trees or power lines).  
✅ **Access to power** — most inflatables require a **dedicated 20-amp outlet per blower** within 100 feet.  
✅ **Surface type** — we can set up on **grass, turf, concrete, asphalt, or indoors**. Let us know your surface in advance.  
🚫 We do **not** set up on gravel, loose rock, or aggregate driveways.

We also need **clear access to the setup area**, including gates wide enough for equipment ( four feet minimum) and no tight turns or steep inclines.

Have a tight space or are unsure if your site will work?  
We offer **on-site walk-throughs for an additional fee** and will gladly help you plan your layout.  
📞 Call us at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)** and we’ll walk you through it!

## ⛅ Weather, Safety & Cancellations

[What if it rains or storms?](#accn16at_0_collapseOne)

**Weather can be unpredictable, but we make it easy.**  
For rescheduling options, safety guidelines, and important policies,  
👉 **[**view our full Weather Policy here**](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/policies/)** before checkout.

[What happens if something gets damaged?](#accn16at_0_collapseThree)

This worked out wonderful! We did not have any problems whatsoever. The delivery was actually early, it was fast, and the kids loved it. Customer service was amazing as well!

10/31/2014

Everyone was so friendly!That includes office personnel as well! The guys who made the delivery worked hard at getting the equipment into the gym. They were so patient while we worked to get the bar out of the gym doors so that the mad lab would fit through. I did not hear these guys complain once while doing this. They were also very patient while I had them roll out the mad lab so that I could see how much room it was going to take up. These two guys were awesome! We already have you on the calendar to order from next year. We appreciate Jump Jump Bounce for the great service.

- **What does the setup and takedown process involve?** Big Thunder's team will handle the complete setup and takedown of the screen and AV equipment, typically requiring about an hour for setup.
- **Can the screen withstand windy conditions?** While the screen is stable, it's best to have a backup indoor location or a reschedule plan for windy or adverse weather conditions.
- **Is the equipment suitable for daytime use?** The screen is best viewed at dusk or in dark conditions. Daytime use might reduce the visual quality due to sunlight.
- **What additional equipment is provided?** Along with the screen, a high-quality projector and sound system are included. Additional rentals like popcorn machines can be arranged.
- **How early should I book?** It's recommended to book as early as possible, especially for popular dates or holiday weekends, to ensure availability.
- **Are there any restrictions on the type of content that can be shown?** Standard content guidelines apply, and it's advised to select movies or presentations suitable for your audience.

Big Thunder Events' inflatable movie screen rentals are a fantastic way to bring the magic of the movies to your event. With easy setup, versatile usage, and the promise of an unforgettable experience, it's an excellent choice for anyone looking to create a memorable event.
