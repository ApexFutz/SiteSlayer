CEREC is a technology used by dentists to design, create, and place ceramic restorations such as [crowns](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), inlays, onlays, and [veneers](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/veneers/) in just one appointment. The technology uses computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software and a milling machine to create the restoration from a solid block of ceramic material.
