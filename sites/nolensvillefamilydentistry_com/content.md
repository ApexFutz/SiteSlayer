### Dr. Lori Adamson

For Dr. Adamson, dentistry is about more than treating teeth—it’s about caring for people. After graduating from Huntingdon College with a double major in Chemistry and Cell Biology in 2004, she pursued her dental degree at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, graduating in 2008. Over the past 17 years, she has served patients across Tennessee and Alabama, most recently practicing in Murfreesboro for 13 years. These experiences have shaped her approach to dentistry: combining technical excellence with a deep commitment to compassion, communication, and genuine connection.  
Dr. Adamson is thrilled to now call Nolensville home for her practice. She looks forward to building long-term relationships with patients, providing excellent care for all ages, and contributing to the incredible sense of community that makes Nolensville so special.  
Outside of dentistry, she leads a rich and joyful life. She loves traveling—her adventures have taken her to Egypt, India, Peru, Easter Island, the Galapagos Islands, Europe, and beyond. She enjoys crafting, crocheting for her favorite charity *The Magic Yarn Project*, spending time with a close-knit circle of friends and family, and, more recently, playing tennis. She also cherishes time with her beloved dog, Chief Air Marshall Fefe McGee—better known as Fefe McGee. And, when the opportunity arises, she’s not above indulging in one of her favorite hobbies: napping.  
Above all, Dr. Adamson is honored to serve the Nolensville community alongside a caring and talented team who share her values of kindness, respect, and integrity. Together, their goal is to create an environment where every patient feels comfortable, understood, and truly cared for.
