SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Instantly Guide New Patients on Your Website

Hi Gulch Dental Studio team,

Every detail on your site reflects your focus on patient comfort, personalized care, and clear communication. I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai, and my team builds custom AI chat agents that help dental practices like yours guide visitors and reduce repetitive calls—without the headache of complicated technology.

To show what I mean, I’ve set up a demo using your public site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_gulchdentalstudio_com

There’s a chat icon in the lower right—click it to open a chat box. Your visitors can type in questions, and the agent replies based only on the information already on your website. 

You can try asking things like:
- Which cosmetic services do you offer, and what’s a smile makeover?
- Do you provide emergency dental appointments and what should I do in an emergency?
- What are the differences between veneers, Invisalign, and bonding?
- How does sedation dentistry work and who qualifies?
- What are my options if I don’t have dental insurance?

Our approach is low-key and practical: we make it easier for your patients to get clear answers so your staff spends less time repeating the basics. If you’d like to see how this could work with the full site or want to discuss further, just reply—I’d be happy to connect.

Best,  
Zac Slay
