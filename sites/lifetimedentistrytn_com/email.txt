SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Answer Patient Questions Instantly on Your Website

Hi there,

I’m reaching out after browsing Lifetime Dentistry’s website—your combination of restorative, cosmetic, and advanced dentistry really stands out, and it’s clear your team goes the extra mile to help patients feel comfortable and informed.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build custom, easy-to-use AI chat agents that sit right on your website, letting visitors quickly get answers by chatting with your existing content—no complicated setup or “AI” buzzwords.

I put together a quick demo using your own site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/lifetimedentistrytn_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the agent, then type in any patient question and get instant answers from your site’s content.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I expect during my first visit?
- Do you offer same-day crowns or CEREC restorations?
- How do dental implants work, and are they right for me?
- What cosmetic options do you have for chipped or stained teeth?
- Do you treat sleep apnea or provide custom mouthguards?

If you’d like to discuss how this could support your patients and free up your team from repetitive questions, I’m happy to chat. No pressure—just let me know if you’re interested!

Best,  
Zac Slay
