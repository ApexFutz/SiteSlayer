## What are Dental Implants?

Dental implants are replacements for missing teeth that serve to look, feel, and function like natural teeth. Surgically placed into the jawbone, the implants and your bone gradually fuse together. This allows for the attachment of the replacement tooth such as crowns, bridges, or dentures.

![Dental care, dental implant, 3d rendering]()

Dental implants not only enhance your smile, but also contribute to the well-being of your oral and overall health. Missing teeth can lead to bone loss, changes in facial structure, and difficulties in speaking and chewing. Dental implants play a crucial role by preventing the shifting of teeth, reducing the risk of gum disease, and promoting proper alignment in the bite.

If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, call today without delay. Our team is here to provide swift and effective care.

### How long does the dental implant process take?

The procedure is a lengthy one. Although the process can vary depending on individual circumstances, it typically takes several months to complete. During the healing period, most patients may expect their dental implants to fully fuse to their jawbone within a few weeks to several months. Once this process is complete, an abutment is attached to the implant followed by the replacement tooth attached to the abutment.

### How long do dental implants last?

With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. Dental implants must be treated like natural teeth: regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups.

## What is Wisdom Teeth Removal?

Wisdom teeth removal is a surgical procedure to extract the third set of molars located at the back of your mouth. These teeth often emerge during late teens or early adulthood and can cause various dental problems due to lack of space. Removing wisdom teeth can prevent issues like overcrowding, misalignment, and infection. The procedure is typically performed under local or general anesthesia by an oral surgeon or dentist.

![Female checking teeth in mirror. Smiling woman at dentist office. Smile wider and be beautiful.]()

## 4 Signs a Wisdom Teeth Removal is Necessary

## Pain or Discomfort

Persistent pain or discomfort in the back of the mouth, often caused by impacted wisdom teeth, can indicate the need for removal.

![Number Icon One]()

## Swelling and Redness

Swelling, redness, or tenderness around the gums at the back of the mouth can be signs of an infection due to impacted wisdom teeth.

Baylie Miller, RDH, BSDH

## What to Expect

The wisdom tooth removal process begins with a consultation where X-rays are taken to assess the position and condition of the wisdom teeth. Before the procedure, local or general anesthesia is administered to ensure comfort during the surgery. The oral surgeon or dentist then makes an incision in the gum tissue to access the tooth and removes the wisdom tooth carefully. After extraction, the area is cleaned, and stitches may be placed to promote healing.

# Dental Onlays and Inlays in Mt Juliet, TN

Experience durable and lasting alternative to conventional fillings. What’s the main difference? Onlays cover the tooth’s cusps, while inlays fill the space between them.

[CALL 615-241-8023](tel:%20615-241-8023)

![Brunette adult asian man smiling and using cellphone at home]()

## What is an Inlay and Onlay?

Inlays and onlays are custom-made dental restorations used to repair moderately damaged or decayed teeth. They are crafted from durable materials such as porcelain or composite resin, and are designed to fit precisely into the prepared cavity of a tooth. Inlays are used to restore the chewing surface of a tooth, while onlays are employed to cover a larger portion of the tooth. 

This procedure is ideal for individuals with moderate to severe tooth decay or damage that cannot be effectively addressed with a traditional filling but doesn’t require a full dental crown. They are particularly suitable for patients who seek a conservative approach to tooth restoration.

## Understanding the Veneers Process

During your initial consultation, our experienced dental team will assess your oral health and discuss your goals and expectations for treatment. If veneers are determined to be the right option for you, we will create a customized treatment plan tailored to your unique needs and desired goals.

The veneer process typically involves three main steps and minimal discomfort. First, your dental team will prepare your teeth by removing a small amount of enamel to accommodate the veneers. Then, they will take impressions of your teeth to create custom-made veneers that fit perfectly. Finally, the veneers are bonded to the front surface of your teeth, instantly transforming your smile.

### What should I do if my tooth is knocked out?

If a permanent tooth is knocked out, rinse it with water and reposition the tooth in the socket immediately before seeing a dentist. If that’s not possible, keep the tooth moist at all times either in your mouth or put it in milk and bring it to our office immediately.

## What Is Gum Disease?

Gum disease, also known as gingivitis, is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the gums. It typically starts with gingivitis, where the gums become swollen and may bleed easily. Without proper treatment, gingivitis can progress to periodontal disease, leading to gum recession, bone loss, and even tooth loss.

Gum disease treatment is a specialized dental service that aims to address the underlying causes, remove plaque and tartar buildup, reduce inflammation, and restore gum health. We provide comprehensive gum disease treatment services to help our patients achieve optimal gum health.

## What to Expect

During the dentures procedure, your dentist will begin with a comprehensive examination of your mouth, including measurements and impressions to ensure a precise fit. Next, any remaining unhealthy teeth that cannot be saved will be extracted to make way for the dentures. Once your mouth has healed, a series of fittings will be conducted to ensure the dentures fit comfortably and securely. Finally, your custom-made dentures will be placed, allowing you to enjoy restored function and a natural-looking smile.

## What is a Dental Filling?

Dental fillings are restorative materials used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay, cracks, or fractures. By filling in the affected area, fillings restore the tooth’s structure, function, and aesthetics. They help prevent further decay, preserve the natural tooth, and promote long-term oral health.

 

Fillings vary in material and characteristics. Amalgam fillings, made from a mixture of metals, are durable and cost-effective but may not match the color of natural teeth. Composite resin offers a natural look but may not be as long-lasting as amalgam fillings. Ceramic and gold fillings offer excellent durability, but are typically more expensive options.

## Polishing

After the filling is placed, your dentist will make final adjustments to ensure proper bite alignment and comfort. The filling is then polished to smooth out any rough edges and blend seamlessly with the surrounding tooth structure.

## The Importance of Dental Fillings

Dental fillings are essential for restoring teeth that have been damaged by decay, cracks, or fractures. Without fillings, these issues can worsen over time, which can lead to further decay, infection, and even tooth loss. By filling cavities and repairing cracks, fillings help prevent the spread of decay and preserve the structural integrity of the tooth. Additionally, fillings restore the functionality of the tooth, allowing for comfortable chewing and speaking. With timely intervention and proper dental care, fillings can effectively address dental issues and maintain optimal oral health for the long term.
