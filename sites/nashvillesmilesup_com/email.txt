Hi Dr. Dudley,

I love how Nashville Smiles Up goes the extra mile to offer accessible, around-the-clock dental care—those real patient stories say it all.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help clinics like yours reduce repetitive calls and make patient information easily available with custom “chat agents” that live right on your website. Visitors can get instant answers pulled directly from your existing site content, no AI jargon or complicated setup.

You can try a live demo right now on a mock version of your own website here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nashvillesmilesup_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, ask a question, and the agent will respond using answers from your site.

For example, you can try asking:
• How do I book an emergency dental appointment?
• What insurances and payment plans do you accept?
• What are your walk-in hours and after-hours procedures?
• Are emergency services available for children?
• How much is the after-hours emergency deposit?

If you’d like to see how this could fit your real site or have any questions, just let me know—happy to chat when it works for you.

Best,  
Zac
