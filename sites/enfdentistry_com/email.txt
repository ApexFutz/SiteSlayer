SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Answers Faster at East Nashville Family Dentistry

Hi there,

I’ve been reviewing how East Nashville Family Dentistry showcases caring service and a wide range of treatments—from preventive cleanings to dental implants and emergency care. Your focus on patient comfort and clear communication stands out.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours reduce repetitive calls and help visitors quickly understand their options, with a simple AI chat agent embedded directly on your website.

I’ve put together a quick interactive demo using your site as an example: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/enfdentistry_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner. You can type in questions, and the agent will answer using your own web content.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I do if I have a dental emergency?
- How much does a dental implant cost?
- Do you offer Invisalign, and how does it work?
- How soon can I get an appointment for a toothache?
- What’s the difference between veneers and bonding?

If this could help make things easier for your team and your patients, I’d be happy to answer questions or show you more.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
