SUBJECT: Make Thingamabob More Interactive—See a Demo with Your Own Content

Hi there,

Love the nostalgic vibe of your NYE 1982 post—Thingamabob really captures those pop culture moments!

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help sites like yours answer visitor questions instantly with a simple, custom chat agent that pulls info from your existing content—no extra setup or complexity needed.

I’ve put together a quick mockup of your homepage with our chat agent added, so you can see how it works: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_thingamabob_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat box and ask anything; the agent replies using what’s already on your site.

You can try questions like:
- What is Thingamabob all about?
- How often do you post new content?
- Can I suggest a #ThingamabobThursday topic?
- Who creates the posts and selects the throwbacks?
- Where can I find more posts from the 1980s?

If this feels useful, I’d be happy to chat about making it work for your site (no pressure). 

Cheers,  
Zac Slay
