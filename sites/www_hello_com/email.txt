SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Keep Visitors Engaged During Your Pause

Hi hello team,

I love your warm approach—even during your pause, it’s clear how much you value your community and want to keep folks in the loop about what’s next.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that sit right on your website, letting visitors ask questions and get answers using the content you already have—no jargon, just clarity.

I set up a quick demo using your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_hello_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner; click it to open the box and try asking questions just like a visitor would.

For example, you can ask things like:
- Why is hello paused right now?
- When will hello be relaunching?
- How will I know when the new version is live?
- Can I still sign up to get updates?
- Is there a way to contact the hello team during the pause?

If you’re curious how this might help keep your community connected, I’d be happy to chat. No pressure—just let me know if you’d like to talk!

Best,  
Zac Slay
