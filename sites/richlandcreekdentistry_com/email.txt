SUBJECT: Make Your Patient Experience Even Smoother—See This Simple Chat Demo

Hi Dr. McNutt and the Richland Creek Family Dentistry team,

I love how your practice focuses on making every patient feel welcome and at ease, whether it’s a first visit or an urgent dental emergency. It’s clear you care deeply about providing reliable information and comfort right from the start.

I'm Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI web agents that help answer common website questions—turning your existing content into clear, quick advice for visitors, all without extra work for your team.

I put together a quick demo, using a mock version of your website: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/richlandcreekdentistry_com. You’ll see a chat icon in the bottom-right corner—just click it, then type a question to see how the agent responds using details already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept or how does your in-office savings plan work?
- How do I request an emergency dental appointment?
- What can I expect during a teeth cleaning?
- Are you accepting new pediatric patients?
- What are your office hours and payment options?

If you think something like this might help decrease repetitive calls and make information easier for patients to find, let me know—I'd be happy to chat or answer any questions.

Best,  
Zac Slay
