Hi Dr. Anway,

Your commitment to trust and a positive, relaxing experience at Mill Creek Dental really stands out. I noticed how welcoming you are to new patients and how thoroughly you explain each service—exactly what folks are looking for in a hometown dental practice.

I’m reaching out from SlayDigital.ai. We build easy-to-use AI chat agents that embed right on your website, helping answer common questions instantly using the info you’re already sharing.

To show you what this could look like, I created a simple demo using your own content: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/millcreekdental_net  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the agent and type a question—your website’s info powers the responses.

You can try asking things like:
- Are you accepting new patients, and how do I schedule an appointment?
- What dental insurance plans do you accept?
- Can you explain the different types of crowns you offer?
- What’s the process and recovery time for a root canal?
- How does your teeth whitening treatment work?

If you’d like to see it tailored for more specific FAQs or want to discuss, I’m happy to chat—no pressure at all.

All the best,  
Zac
