SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Answers—Instantly—on Your Site

Hi Music City Dental team,

I appreciate how your site emphasizes both advanced dental care and patient comfort—exactly what people want in a dentist. I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI web agents that help visitors get clear, instant answers from your site, reducing repetitive questions for your team.

To show what this could look like for you, I made a mock version of your website with a working demo agent: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/musiccitydental_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right to open the chat box, then ask questions—your agent will reply using only info from your own site.

You can try asking things like:
- What’s included in the Priority Care Membership Club, and how much does it cost?
- What types of dental technology do you use for patient comfort?
- Can I book an appointment if I don’t have dental insurance?
- Do you offer sedation dentistry, and how does it work?
- Which procedures do you provide for dental implants?

If this could help free up your team and help Nashville patients get the info they need, I’d be happy to talk more. Let me know if you’d like a walkthrough or have questions.

Best,  
Zac Slay
