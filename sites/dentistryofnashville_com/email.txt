SUBJECT: Simple way to answer patient questions instantly on your site

Hi there,

I admire how Dentistry of Nashville emphasizes comfort, family values, and advanced technology for your patients. It’s clear you put a lot of care into making each visit easy and reassuring.

I’m Zac Slay, the founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours reduce repetitive calls and make information even more accessible by adding a custom, AI-powered web agent to your site. This simple chat tool instantly answers visitor questions using your own content—no jargon or technical hoops, just clear answers for your patients.

Here’s a demo of what this could look like for Dentistry of Nashville:

There’s a chat icon in the bottom right corner—just click it, type a question, and see the agent respond based on your website’s information.

You can try asking things like:
- “What is LANAP, and how does it work?”
- “How long does it take to get a same-day crown?”
- “Do you offer dental implant consultations?”
- “How do I schedule an appointment?”
- “What cosmetic services can help me improve my smile?”

If this sounds useful, I’d be glad to chat about making it uniquely yours. No pressure—just let me know if you’d like more details!

Warmly,  
Zac Slay
