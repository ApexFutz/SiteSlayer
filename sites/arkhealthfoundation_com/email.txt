SUBJECT: Helping Veterans Access Answers Faster on the ARK Health Foundation Site

-----------------------------------------

Hi Brandon,

I’m truly inspired by the ARK Health Foundation’s mission to restore, recover, and rebuild the health of veterans through advanced, stigma-free wellness programming. The clarity and care you put into explaining how your program breaks barriers to recovery comes through on every page.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI web agents that turn your website into a direct, 24/7 resource—helping visitors quickly find the info they need by chatting directly with your content (no jargon, just clear answers).

We created a quick demo using your own content: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/arkhealthfoundation_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open it, then type any question; the agent replies with clear info drawn from your actual site.

You can try asking things like:
- What makes ARK’s trauma recovery program different from traditional approaches?
- Who is eligible to join your program, and how do they get started?
- What types of therapies and diagnostics are available for veterans?
- How can someone support or donate to your mission?
- Where can I find the science behind your methodology?

If this feels like something that could help answer veterans’ and supporters’ most common questions—or save your team time—I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Thank you for all you do,

Zac
